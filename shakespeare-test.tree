and held me hard then goes he to the length of all his arm and with his other hand thus oer his brow he falls to such perusal of my face as he would draw it long stayd he so at last a little shaking of mine arm and thrice his head thus waving up and down he raisd a sigh so piteous and profound as it did seem to shatter all his bulk and end his being that done he lets me go and with his head over his shoulder turnd he seemd to find his way without his eyes for out o doors he went without their help and to the last bended their light on me pol come go with me i will go seek the king this is the

sterile promontory this most excellent canopy the air look you this brave oerhanging firmament this majestical roof fretted with golden fire why it appeareth no other thing to me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours what a piece of work is a man how noble in reason how infinite in faculties in form and moving how express and admirable in action how like an angel in apprehension

holds it no sin to tarre them to controversy there was for a while no money bid for argument unless the poet and the player went to cuffs in the question ham ist possible guil o there has been much throwing about of brains ham do the boys carry it away ros ay that they do my lord hercules and his load too ham it is not very strange for my uncle is king of denmark and those that would make mows

but it was never acted or if it was not above once for the play i remember pleasd not the million twas caviary to the general but it was as i receivd it and others whose judgments in such matters cried in the top of mine an excellent play well digested in the scenes set down with as much modesty as cunning i remember one said there were no sallets in the lines to make the matter savoury nor no matter in the phrase that might indict the author of affectation but calld it an honest method as wholesome as sweet and by very much more handsome than fine one speech int i chiefly lovd twas aeneas

and with a hideous crash takes prisoner pyrrhus ear for lo his sword which was declining on the milky head of reverend priam seemd i th air to stick so as a painted tyrant pyrrhus stood and like a neutral to his will and matter did nothing but as we often see against some storm a silence in the heavens the rack stand still the bold winds speechless and the orb below as hush as death anon the dreadful thunder doth rend the region so after pyrrhus pause aroused vengeance sets him new awork and never did the cyclops hammers fall on marss armour forgd for proof eterne with less remorse than

well ros most like a gentleman guil but with much forcing of his disposition ros niggard of question but of our demands most free in his reply queen did you assay him to any pastime ros madam it so fell out that certain players we oerraught on the way of these we told him and there did seem in him a kind of joy to hear of it they are here about the court and as i think they have already order this night to play before him pol tis most true and he beseechd me to entreat your majesties to hear and see the matter king with all my heart and it doth much content me to hear him so inclind good

my deed to my most painted word o heavy burthen pol i hear him coming lets withdraw my lord exeunt king and polonius enter hamlet ham to be or not to be that is the question whether tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune or to take arms against a sea of troubles and by opposing end them to die to sleep no more and by a sleep to say we end the heartache and the thousand natural shocks that flesh is heir to tis a consummation devoutly to be wishd to die to sleep to sleep perchance to dream ay theres the rub for in that sleep of death what dreams may come when we have shuffled off this mortal coil must give us pause theres the respect that makes calamity of so long life for who would bear the whips and scorns of time th oppressors wrong the proud mans contumely the pangs of despisd love the laws delay the insolence of office and the spurns that patient merit of th unworthy takes when he himself might his quietus make with a bare bodkin who would these fardels bear to grunt and sweat under a weary life but that the dread of something after death the undiscoverd country from whose bourn no traveller returns puzzles the will and makes us rather bear those ills we have than fly to others that we know not of thus conscience does make cowards of us all and thus the native hue of resolution is sicklied oer with the pale cast of thought and

crimeful and so capital in nature as by your safety wisdom all things else you mainly were stirrd up king o for two special reasons which may to you perhaps seein much unsinewd but yet to me they are strong the queen his mother lives almost by his looks and for myself my virtue or my plague be it either which shes so conjunctive to my life and soul that as the star moves not but in his sphere i could not but by her the other motive why to a public count i might not go is the great love the general gender bear him who dipping all his faults in their affection would like the spring that turneth wood to stone convert his gives to graces so that my arrows too slightly timberd for so loud a wind would have reverted to my bow again and not where i had aimd them laer and so have i a noble father lost a sister driven into desprate terms whose worth if praises may go back again stood challenger on mount of all the age for her perfections but my revenge will come king break not your

strange return hamlet what should this mean are all the rest come back or is it some abuse and no such thing laer know you the hand king tis hamlets character naked and in a postscript here he says alone can you advise me laer i am lost in it my lord but let him come it warms the very sickness in my heart that i shall live and tell him to his teeth thus didest thou king if it be so laertes as how should it be so how otherwise will you be ruld by me laer ay my lord so you will not oerrule me to a peace king to thine own peace if he be now returnd as checking at his voyage and that he means no more to undertake it i will work him to exploit now ripe in my device under the which he shall not choose but fall and for his death no wind but even his mother shall uncharge the practice and call it accident laer my lord i will be ruld the rather if you could devise it so that i might be the organ king it falls right you have been talkd of since your travel much and that in hamlets hearing for a quality wherein they say you shine your sun of parts did not together pluck such envy from him as did that one and that in my regard of the unworthiest siege laer what part is that my lord king a very riband in the cap of youth yet needfull too for youth no less becomes the light and careless livery that it wears thin settled age his sables and his weeds importing health and graveness two months since here was a gentleman of normandy i have seen myself and servd against the french and they can well on horseback but this gallant had witchcraft int he grew unto his seat and to such wondrous doing brought his horse as had he been incorpsd and deminaturd with the brave beast so far he toppd my thought that i in forgery of shapes and tricks come short of what he did laer a norman wast king a norman laer upon my life lamound king the very same laer i know him well he is the broach indeed and gem of all the nation king he made confession of you and gave you such a masterly report for art and exercise in your defence and for your rapier most especially that he cried out twould be a sight indeed if one could match you the scrimers of their nation he swore had neither motion guard nor eye if you opposd them sir this report of his did hamlet so envenom with his envy that he could nothing do but wish and beg your sudden coming oer to play with you now out of this laer what out of this my lord king laertes was your father dear to you or are you like the painting of a sorrow a face without a heart laer why ask you this king not that i think you did not love your father but that i know love is begun by time and that i see in passages of proof time qualifies the spark and fire of it there lives within the very flame of love a kind of wick or snuff that will abate it and nothing is at a like goodness still for goodness growing to a plurisy dies in his own toomuch that we would do we should do when we would for this would changes and hath abatements and delays as many as there are tongues are hands are accidents and then this should is like a spendthrift sigh that hurts by easing but to the quick o th ulcer hamlet comes back what would you undertake to show yourself your fathers son in deed more than in words laer to cut his throat i th church king no place indeed should murther sanctuarize revenge should have no bounds but good laertes will you do this keep close within your chamber will returnd shall know you are come home well put on those shall praise your excellence and set a double varnish on the fame the frenchman gave you bring you in fine together and wager on your heads he being remiss most generous and free from all contriving will not peruse the foils so that with ease or with a little shuffling you may choose a sword unbated and in a pass of practice requite him for your father laer i will dot and for that purpose ill anoint my sword i bought an unction of a mountebank so mortal that but dip a knife in it where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare collected from all simples that have virtue under the moon can save the thing from death this is but scratchd withal ill touch my point with this contagion that if i gall him slightly it may be death king lets further think of this weigh what convenience both of time and means may fit us to our shape if this should fall and that our drift look through our bad performance twere better not assayd therefore this project should have a back or second that might hold if this did blast in proof soft let me see well make a solemn wager on your cunnings i hat when

shall find in him the continent of what part a gentleman would see ham sir his definement suffers no perdition in you though i know to divide him inventorially would dozy th arithmetic of memory and yet but yaw neither in respect of his quick sail but in the verity of extolment i take him to be a soul of great article and his infusion of such dearth and rareness as to make true diction of him his semblable is his mirror and who else would trace him his umbrage nothing more osr your lordship speaks most infallibly of him ham the concernancy sir why do we wrap the gentleman in our more rawer

delicate carriages and of very liberal conceit ham what call you the carriages hor aside to hamlet i knew you must be edified by the margent ere you had done osr the carriages sir are the hangers ham the phrase would be more germane to the matter if we could carry cannon by our sides i would it might be hangers till then but on six barbary horses against six french swords their assigns and three liberalconceited carriages thats the french bet against the danish why is this all impond as you call it osr the king sir hath laid that in a dozen passes between yourself and him he shall not exceed you three hits he hath laid on twelve for nine and it would come to immediate trial if your lordship would vouchsafe the answer ham how if i answer no osr i mean my lord the opposition of your person

continual practice i shall win at the odds but thou wouldst not think how ill alls here about my heart but it is no matter hor nay good my lord ham it is but foolery but it is such a kind of gaingiving as would perhaps trouble a woman hor if your mind dislike anything obey it i will forestall their repair hither and say you are not fit ham not a whit we defy augury theres a special providence in the fall of a sparrow if it be now tis not to come if it be not to come it will be now if it be not now yet it will come the readiness is all since no man knows aught of what he leaves

when they seldom come they wishdfor come and nothing pleaseth but rare accidents so when this loose behaviour i throw off and pay the debt i never promised by how much better than my word i am by so much shall i falsify mens hopes and like bright metal on a sullen ground my reformation glittring oer my fault shall show more goodly and attract more eyes than that which hath no foil to set it off ill so offend to make offence a skill redeeming time when men think least i will exit scene iii london the palace enter the king northumberland worcester hotspur sir walter blunt with others king my blood hath been too cold and temperate unapt to stir at these indignities and you have found me for accordingly you tread upon my patience but be sure i will from henceforth rather be myself mighty and to be feard than my condition which hath been smooth as oil soft as young down and therefore lost that title of respect which the proud soul neer pays but to the proud wor our house my sovereign liege little deserves the scourge of greatness to be usd on it and that same greatness too which our own hands have holp to make so portly north my lord king worcester get thee gone for i do see danger and disobedience in thine eye o sir your presence is too bold and peremptory and majesty might never yet endure the moody frontier of a servant brow tou have good leave to leave us when we need your use and counsel we shall send for you exit worcester you were about to speak north yea my good lord those prisoners in your highness name demanded which harry percy here at holmedon took were as he says not with such strength denied as is delivered to your majesty either envy therefore or misprision is guilty of this fault and not my son hot my liege i did deny no prisoners but i remember when the fight was done when i was dry with rage and extreme toll breathless and faint leaning upon my sword came there a certain lord neat and trimly dressd fresh as a bridegroom and his chin new reapd showd like a stubble land at harvest home he was perfumed like a milliner and twixt his finger and his thumb he held a pouncet box which ever and anon he gave his nose and tookt away again who therewith angry when it next came there took it in snuff and still he smild and talkd and as the soldiers bore dead bodies by he calld them untaught knaves unmannerly to bring a slovenly unhandsome corse betwixt the wind and his nobility with many holiday and lady terms he questioned me amongst the rest demanded my prisoners in your majestys behalf i then all smarting with my wounds being cold to be so pestred with a popingay out of my grief and my impatience answerd neglectingly i know not what he should or he should not for he made me mad to see him shine so brisk and smell so sweet and talk so like a waiting gentlewoman of guns and drums and wounds god save the mark and telling me the sovereignest thing on earth was parmacity for an inward bruise and that it was great pity so it was this villanous saltpetre should be diggd out of the bowels of the harmless earth which many a good tall fellow had destroyd so cowardly and but for these vile guns he would himself have been a soldier this bald unjointed chat of his my lord i answered indirectly as i said and i beseech you let not his report come current for an accusation betwixt my love and your high majesty blunt the circumstance considered good my lord whateer lord harry percy then had said to such a person and in such a place at such a time with all the rest retold may reasonably die and never rise to do him wrong or any way impeach what then he said so he unsay it now king why yet he doth deny his prisoners but with proviso and exception that we at our own charge shall ransom straight his brotherinlaw the foolish mortimer who on my soul hath wilfully betrayd the lives of those that he did lead to fight against that great magician damnd glendower whose daughter as we hear the earl of march hath lately married shall our coffers then be emptied to redeem a traitor home shall we buy treason and indent with fears when they have lost and forfeited themselves no on the barren mountains let him starve for i shall never hold that man my friend whose tongue shall ask me for one penny cost to ransom home revolted mortimer hot revolted mortimer he never did fall off my sovereign liege but by the chance of war to prove that true needs no more but one tongue for all those wounds those mouthed wounds which valiantly he took when on the gentle severns sedgy bank in single opposition hand to hand he did confound the best part of an hour in changing hardiment with great glendower three times they breathd and three times did they drink upon agreement of swift severns flood who then affrighted with their bloody looks ran fearfully among the trembling reeds and hid his crisp head in the hollow bank bloodstained with these valiant cohabitants never did base and rotten policy colour her working with such deadly wounds nor never could the noble mortimer receive so many and all willingly then let not him be slandered with revolt king thou dost belie him percy thou dost belie him he never did encounter with glendower i tell thee he durst as well have met the devil alone as owen glendower for an enemy art thou not ashamd but sirrah henceforth let me not hear you speak of mortimer send me your prisoners with the speediest means or you shall hear in such a kind from me as will displease you my lord northumberland we license your departure with your son send us your prisoners or you will hear of it exeunt king blunt and train hot an if the devil come and roar for them i will not send them i will after straight and tell him so for i will else my heart albeit i make a hazard of my head north what drunk with choler stay and pause awhile here comes your uncle enter worcester hot speak of mortimer zounds i will speak of him and let my soul want mercy if i do not join with him yea on his part ill empty all these veins and shed my dear blood drop by drop in the dust but i will lift the downtrod mortimer as high in the air as this unthankful king as this ingrate and cankred bolingbroke north brother the king hath made your nephew mad wor who struck this heat up after i was gone hot he will forsooth have all my prisoners and when i urgd the ransom once again of my wives brother then his cheek lookd pale and on my face he turnd an eye of death trembling even at the name of mortimer wor i cannot blame him was not he proclaimd by richard that dead is the next of blood north he was i heard the proclamation and then it was when the unhappy king whose wrongs in us god pardon did set forth upon his irish expedition from whence he intercepted did return to be deposd and shortly murdered wor and for whose death we in the worlds wide mouth live scandalizd and foully spoken of hot but soft i pray you did king richard then proclaim my brother edmund mortimer heir to the crown north he did myself did hear it hot nay then i cannot blame his cousin king that wishd him on the barren mountains starve but shall it be that you that set the crown upon the head of this forgetful man and for his sake wear the detested blot of murtherous subornation shall it be that you a world of curses undergo being the agents or base second means the cords the ladder or the hangman rather o pardon me that i descend so low to show the line and the predicament wherein you range under this subtile king shall it for shame be spoken in these days or fill up chronicles in time to come that men of your nobility and power did gage them both in an unjust behalf as both of you god pardon it have done to put down richard that sweet lovely rose and plant this thorn this canker bolingbroke and shall it in more shame be further spoken that you are foold discarded and shook off by him for whom these shames ye underwent no yet time serves wherein you may redeem your banishd honours and restore yourselves into the good thoughts of the world again revenge the jeering and disdaind contempt of this proud king who studies day and night to answer all the debt he owes to you even with the bloody payment of your deaths therefore i say wor peace cousin say no more and now i will unclasp a secret book and to your quickconceiving discontents ill read you matter deep and dangerous as full of peril and adventurous spirit as to oerwalk a current roaring loud on the unsteadfast footing of a spear hot if he fall in good night or sink or swim send danger from the east unto the west so honour cross it from the north to south and let them grapple o the blood more stirs to rouse a lion than to start a hare north imagination of some great exploit drives him beyond the bounds of patience hot by heaven methinks it were an easy leap to pluck bright honour from the palefacd moon or dive into the bottom of the deep where fadom line could never touch the ground and pluck up drowned honour by the locks so he that doth redeem her thence might wear without corrival all her dignities but out upon this halffacd fellowship wor he apprehends a world of figures here but not the form of what he should attend good cousin give me audience for a while hot i cry you mercy wor those same noble scots that are your prisoners hot ill keep them all by god he shall not have a scot of them no if a scot would save his soul he shall not ill keep them by this hand wor you start away and lend no ear unto my purposes those prisoners you shall keep hot nay i will that is flat he said he would not ransom mortimer forbade my tongue to speak of mortimer but i will find him when he lies asleep and in his ear ill holloa mortimer nay ill have a starling shall be taught to speak nothing but mortimer and give it him to keep his anger still in motion wor hear you cousin a word hot all studies here i solemnly defy save how to gall and pinch this bolingbroke and that same swordandbuckler prince of wales but that i think his father loves him not and would be glad he met with some mischance i would have him poisoned with a pot of ale wor farewell kinsman i will talk to you when you are better temperd to attend north why what a waspstung and impatient fool art thou to break into this womans mood tying thine ear to no tongue but thine own hot why look you i am whippd and scourgd with rods nettled and stung with pismires when i hear of this vile politician bolingbroke in richards time what do you call the place a plague upon it it is in gioucestershire twas where the madcap duke his uncle kept his uncle york where i first bowd my knee unto this king of smiles this bolingbroke s blood when you and he came back from ravenspurgh north at berkeley castle hot you say true why what a candy deal of courtesy this fawning greyhound then did proffer me look when his infant fortune came to age and gentle harry percy and kind cousin o the devil take such cozeners god forgive me good uncle tell your tale for i have done wor nay if you have not to it again we will stay your leisure hot i have done i faith wor then once more to your scottish prisoners deliver them up without their ransom straight and make the douglas son your only mean for powers in scotland which for divers reasons which i shall send you written be assurd will easily be granted to northumberland you my lord your son in scotland being thus employd shall secretly into the bosom creep of that same noble prelate wellbelovd the archbishop hot of york is it not wor true who bears hard his brothers death at bristow the lord scroop i speak not this in estimation as what i think might be but what i know is ruminated plotted and set down and only stays but to behold the face of that occasion that shall bring it on hot i smell it upon my life it will do well north before the game is afoot thou still letst slip hot why it cannot choose but be a noble plot and then the power of scotland and of york to join with mortimer ha wor and so they shall hot in faith it is exceedingly well aimd wor and tis no little reason bids us speed to save our heads by raising of a head for bear ourselves as even as we can the king will always think him in our debt and think we think ourselves unsatisfied till he hath found a time to pay us home and see already how he doth begin to make us strangers to his looks of love hot he does he does well be revengd on him wor cousin farewell no further go in this than i by letters shall direct your course when time is ripe which will be suddenly ill steal to glendower and lord mortimer where you and douglas and our powrs at once as i will fashion it shall happily meet to bear our fortunes in our own strong arms which now we hold at much uncertainty north farewell good

desires such poor such bare such lewd such mean attempts such barren pleasures rude society as thou art matchd withal and grafted to accompany the greatness of thy blood and hold their level with thy princely heart prince so please your majesty i would i could quit all offences with as clear excuse as well as i am doubtless i can purge myself of many i am charged withal yet such extenuation let me beg as in reproof of many tales devisd which oft the ear of greatness needs must bear by smiling pickthanks and base newsmongers i may for some things true wherein my youth hath faulty wandred and irregular and pardon on lily true submission king god pardon thee yet let me wonder harry at thy affections which do hold a wing quite from the flight of all thy ancestors thy place in council thou hast rudely lost which by thy younger brother is supplied and art almost an alien to the hearts of all the court and princes of my blood the hope and expectation of thy time is ruind and the soul of every man prophetically do forethink thy fall had i so lavish of my presence been so commonhackneyd in the eyes of men so stale and cheap to vulgar company opinion that did help me to the crown had still kept loyal to possession and left me in reputeless banishment a fellow of no mark nor likelihood by being seldom seen i could not stir but like a comet i was wondred at that men would tell their children this is he others would say where which is bolingbroke and then i stole all courtesy from heaven and dressd myself in such humility that i did pluck allegiance from mens hearts loud shouts and salutations from their mouths even in the presence of the crowned king thus did i keep my person fresh and new my presence like a robe pontifical neer seen but wondred at and so my state seldom but sumptuous showd like a feast and won by rareness such solemnity the skipping king he ambled up and down with shallow jesters and rash bavin wits soon kindled and soon burnt carded his state mingled his royalty with capring fools had his great name profaned with their scorns and gave his countenance against his name to laugh at gibing boys and stand the push of every beardless vain comparative grew a companion to the common streets enfeoffd himself to popularity that being dally swallowed by mens eyes they surfeited with honey and began to loathe the taste of sweetness whereof a little more than a little is by much too much so when he had occasion to be seen he was but as the cuckoo is in june heard not regarded seen but with such eyes as sick and blunted with community afford no extraordinary gaze such as is bent on unlike majesty when it shines seldom in admiring eyes but rather drowsd and hung their eyelids down slept in his face and rendred such aspect as cloudy men use to their adversaries being with his presence glutted gorgd and full and in that very line harry standest thou for thou hast lost thy princely privilege with vile participation not an eye but is aweary of thy common sight save mine which hath desird to see thee more which now doth that i would not have it do make blind itself with foolish tenderness prince i shall hereafter my thricegracious lord be more myself king for all the world as thou art to this hour was richard then when i from france set foot at ravenspurgh and even as i was then is percy now now by my sceptre and my soul to boot he hath more worthy interest to the state than thou the shadow of succession for of no right nor colour like to right he doth fill fields with harness in the realm turns head against the lions armed jaws and being no more in debt to years than thou leads ancient lords and reverend bishops on to bloody battles and to bruising arms what neverdying honour hath he got against renowmed douglas whose high deeds whose hot incursions and great name in arms holds from all soldiers chief majority and military title capital through all the kingdoms that acknowledge christ thrice hath this hotspur mars in swathling clothes this infant warrior in his enterprises discomfited great douglas taen him once enlarged him and made a friend of him to fill the mouth of deep defiance up and shake the peace and safety of our throne and what say you to this percy northumberland the archbishops grace of york douglas mortimer capitulate against us and are up but wherefore do i tell these news to thee why harry do i tell thee of my foes which art my nearest and dearest enemy thou that art like enough through vassal fear base inclination and the start of spleen to fight against me under percys pay to dog his heels and curtsy at his frowns to show how much thou art degenerate prince do not think so you shall not find it so and god forgive them that so much have swayd your majestys good thoughts away from me i will redeem all this on percys head and in the closing of some glorious day be bold to tell you that i am your son when i will wear a garment all of blood and stain my favours in a bloody mask which washd away shall scour my shame with it and that shall be the day wheneer it lights that this same child of honour and renown this gallant hotspur this allpraised knight and your unthought of harry chance to meet for every honour sitting on his helm would they were multitudes and on my head my shames redoubled for the time will come that i shall make this northern youth exchange his glorious deeds for my indignities percy is but my factor good my lord to engross up glorious deeds on my behalf and i will call hall to so strict account that he shall render every glory up yea even the slightest worship of his time or i will tear the reckoning from his heart this in the name of god i promise here the which if he be pleasd i shall perform i do beseech your majesty may salve the longgrown wounds of my intemperance if not the end of life cancels all bands and i will die a hundred thousand deaths ere break the smallest parcel of this vow king a hundred thousand rebels

against anointed majesty but to my charge the king hath sent to know the nature of your griefs and whereupon you conjure from the breast of civil peace such bold hostility teaching his duteous land audacious cruelty if that the king have any way your good deserts forgot which he confesseth to be manifold he bids you name your griefs and with all speed you shall have your desires with interest and pardon absolute for yourself and these herein misled by your suggestion hot the king is kind and well we know the king knows at what time to promise when to pay my father and my uncle and myself did give him that same royalty he wears and when he was not sixandtwenty strong sick in the worlds regard wretched and low a poor unminded outlaw sneaking home my father gave him welcome to the shore and when he heard him swear and vow to god he came but to be duke of lancaster to sue his livery and beg his peace with tears of innocency and terms of zeal my father in kind heart and pity movd swore him assistance and performed it too now when the lords and barons of the realm perceivd northumberland did lean to him the more and less came in with cap and knee met him on boroughs cities villages attended him on bridges stood in lanes laid gifts before him profferd him their oaths give him their heirs as pages followed him even at the heels in golden multitudes he presently as greatness knows itself steps me a little higher than his vow made to my father while his blood was poor upon the naked shore at ravenspurgh and now forsooth takes on him to reform some certain edicts and some strait decrees that lie too heavy on the commonwealth cries out upon abuses seems to weep over his countrys wrongs and by this face this seeming brow of justice did he win the hearts of all that he did angle for proceeded further cut me off the heads of all the favourites that the absent king in deputation left behind him here when he was personal in the irish war but tut i came not to hear this hot then to the point in short time after lie deposd the king soon after that deprivd him of his life and in the neck of that taskd the whole state to make that worse suffred his kinsman march who is if every owner were well placid indeed his king to be engagd in wales there without ransom to lie forfeited disgracd me in my happy victories sought to entrap me by intelligence rated mine uncle from the council board in rage dismissd my father from the court broke an oath on oath committed wrong on wrong and in conclusion drove us to seek out this head of safety and withal to pry into his title the which we find too indirect for long continuance blunt shall i return this answer to the king hot not so sir walter well withdraw awhile go to the king and let there be impawnd some surety for a safe

our party northumberland how doth my son and brother thou tremblest and the whiteness in thy cheek is apter than thy tongue to tell thy errand even such a man so faint so spiritless so dull so dread in look so woebegone drew priams curtain in the dead of night and would have told him half his troy was burnt but priam found the fire ere he his tongue and i my percys death ere thou reportst it this thou wouldst say your son did thus and thus your brother thus so fought the noble douglas stopping my greedy ear with their bold deeds but in the end to stop my ear indeed thou hast a sigh to blow away this praise ending with brother son and all are dead morton douglas is living and your brother yet but for my lord your son northumberland why he is dead see what a ready tongue suspicion hath he that but fears the thing he would not know hath by instinct knowledge from others eyes that what he feard is chanced yet speak morton tell thou an earl his divination lies and i will take it as a sweet disgrace and make thee rich for doing me such wrong morton you are too great to be by me gainsaid your spirit is too true your fears too certain northumberland yet for all this say not that percys dead i see a strange confession in thine eye thou shakst thy head and holdst it fear or sin to speak a truth if he be slain say so the tongue offends not that reports his death and he doth sin that doth belie the dead not he which says the dead is not alive yet the first bringer of unwelcome news hath but a losing office and his tongue sounds ever after as a sullen bell remembred tolling a departing friend lord bardolph i cannot think my lord your son is dead morton i am sorry i should force you to believe that which i would to god i had not seen but these mine eyes saw him in bloody state rendring faint quittance wearied and outbreathd to harry monmouth whose swift wrath beat down the neverdaunted percy to the earth from whence with life he never more sprung up in few his death whose spirit lent a fire even to the dullest peasant in his camp being bruited once took fire and heat away from the besttemperd courage in his troops for from his metal was his party steeled which once in him abated an the rest turnd on themselves like dull and heavy lead and as the thing thats heavy in itself upon enforcement flies with greatest speed so did our men heavy in hotspurs loss lend to this weight such lightness with their fear that arrows fled not swifter toward their aim than did our soldiers aiming at their safety fly from the field then was that noble worcester too soon taen prisoner and that furious scot the bloody douglas whose welllabouring sword had three times slain th appearance of the king gan vail his stomach and did grace the shame of those that turnd their backs and in his flight stumbling in fear was took the sum of all is that the king hath won and hath sent out a speedy power to encounter you my lord under the conduct of young lancaster and westmoreland this is the news at full northumberland for this i shall have time enough to mourn in poison there is physic and these news having been well that would have made me sick being sick have in some

morton sweet earl divorce not wisdom from your honour the lives of all your loving complices lean on your health the which if you give oer to stormy passion must perforce decay you cast th event of war my noble lord and summd the account of chance before you said let us make head it was your presurmise that in the dole of blows your son might drop you knew he walkd oer perils on an edge more likely to fall in than to get oer you were advisd his flesh was capable of wounds and scars and that his forward spirit would lift him where most trade of danger rangd yet did you say go forth and none of this though strongly apprehended could restrain the stiffborne action what hath then befalln or what hath this bold enterprise brought forth more than that being which was like to be lord bardolph we all that are engaged to this loss knew that we ventured on such dangerous seas that if we wrought out life twas ten to one and yet we venturd for the gain proposd chokd the respect of likely peril feard and since we are oerset venture again come we will put forth body and goods morton tis more than time and my most noble lord i hear for certain and dare speak the truth the gentle archbishop of york is up with wellappointed powrs he is a man who with a double surety binds his followers my lord your son had only but the corpse but shadows and the shows of men to fight for that same word rebellion did divide the action of their bodies from their souls and they did fight with queasiness constraind as men drink potions that their weapons only seemd on our side but for their

archbishops palace enter the archbishop thomas mowbray the earl marshal lord hastings and lord bardolph archbishop thus have you heard our cause and known our means and my most noble friends i pray you all speak plainly your opinions of our hopes and first lord marshal what say you to it mowbray i well allow the occasion of our amis but gladly would be better satisfied how in our means we should advance ourselves to look with forehead bold and big enough upon the power and puissance of the king hastings our present musters grow upon the file to five and twenty thousand men of choice and our supplies live largely in the hope of great northumberland whose bosom burns with an incensed fire of injuries lord bardolph the question then lord hastings standeth thus whether our present five and twenty thousand may hold up head without northumberland hastings with him we may lord bardolph yea marry theres the point but if without him we be thought too feeble my judgment is we should not step too far till we had his assistance by the hand for in a theme so bloodyfacd as this conjecture expectation and surmise of aids incertain should not be admitted archbishop tis very true lord bardolph for indeed it was young hotspurs case at shrewsbury lord bardolph it was my lord who lind himself with hope eating the air and promise of supply flattring himself in project of a power much smaller than the smallest of his thoughts and so with great imagination proper to madmen led his powers to death and winking leapt into destruction hastings but by your leave it never yet did hurt to lay down likelihoods and forms of hope lord bardolph yes if this present quality of war indeed the instant action a cause on foot lives so in hope as in an early spring we see th appearing buds which to prove fruit hope gives not so much warrant as despair that frosts will bite them when we mean to build we first survey the plot then draw the model and when we see the figure of the house then we must rate the cost of the erection which if we find outweighs ability what do we then but draw anew the model in fewer offices or at least desist to build at all much more in this great work which is almost to pluck a kingdom down and set another up should we survey the plot of situation and the model consent upon a sure foundation question surveyors know our own estate how able such a work to undergo to weigh against his opposite or else we fortify in paper and in figures using the names of men instead of men like one that draws the model of a house beyond his power to build it who half through gives oer and leaves his partcreated cost a naked subject to the weeping clouds and waste for churlish winters tyranny hastings grant that our hopes yet likely of fair birth should be stillborn and that we now possessd the utmost man of expectation i think we are so a body strong enough even as we are to equal with the king lord bardolph what is the king but five and twenty thousand hastings to us no more nay not so much lord bardolph for his divisions as the times do brawl are in three heads one power against the french and one against glendower perforce a third must take up us so is the unfirm king in three divided and his coffers sound with hollow poverty and emptiness archbishop that he should draw his several strengths together and come against us in full puissance need not be dreaded hastings if he should do so he leaves his back unarmd the french and welsh baying at his heels never fear that lord bardolph who is it like should lead his forces hither hastings the duke of lancaster and westmoreland against the welsh himself and harry monmouth but who is substituted against the french i have no certain notice archbishop let us on and publish the occasion of our arms the commonwealth is sick of their own choice their overgreedy love hath surfeited an habitation giddy and unsure hath he that buildeth on the vulgar heart o thou fond many with what loud applause didst thou beat heaven with blessing bolingbroke before he was what thou wouldst have him be and being now trimmd in thine own desires thou beastly feeder art so full of him that thou provokst thyself to

of the wildness of his youth and the feats he hath done about turnbull street and every third word a lie duer paid to the hearer than the turks tribute i do remember him at clements inn like a man made after supper of a cheeseparing when a was naked he was for all the world like a forkd radish with a head fantastically carved upon it with a knife a was so forlorn that his dimensions to any thick sight were invisible a was the very genius of famine yet lecherous as a monkey and the whores calld him mandrake a came ever in the rearward of the fashion and sung those tunes to the overscutchd huswifes that he heard the carmen whistle and sware they were his fancies or his goodnights and now is this vices dagger become a squire and talks as familiarly of john a gaunt as if he had been sworn brother to him and ill be sworn a neer saw him but once in the tiltyard and then he burst his head for crowding among the marshals men i saw it and told john a gaunt he beat his own name for you might have thrust him and all his apparel into an eelskin the case of a treble hautboy was a mansion for him a court and now has he land and beeves well ill be acquainted with him if i

shall please your grace archbishop here stand my lords and send discoverers forth to know the numbers of our enemies hastings we have sent forth already archbishop tis well done my friends and brethren in these great affairs i must acquaint you that i have receivd newdated letters from northumberland their cold intent tenour and substance thus here doth he wish his person with such powers as might hold sortance with his quality the which he could not levy whereupon he is retird to ripe his growing fortunes to scotland and concludes in hearty prayers that your attempts may overlive the hazard and fearful meeting of their opposite mowbray thus do the hopes we have in him touch ground and dash themselves to pieces enter a messenger hastings now what news messenger west of this forest scarcely off a mile in goodly form comes on the enemy and by the ground they hide i judge their number upon or near the rate of thirty thousand mowbray the just proportion that we gave them out let us sway on and face them in the field enter westmoreland archbishop what wellappointed leader fronts us here mowbray i think it is my lord of westmoreland westmoreland health and fair greeting from our general the prince lord john and duke of lancaster archbishop say on my lord of westmoreland in peace what doth concern your coming westmoreland then my lord unto your grace do i in chief address the substance of my speech if that rebellion came like itself in base and abject routs led on by bloody youth guarded with rags and countenancd by boys and beggary i say if damnd commotion so appeard in his true native and most proper shape you reverend father and these noble lords had not been here to dress the ugly form of base and bloody insurrection with your fair honours you lord archbishop whose see is by a civil peace maintaind whose beard the silver hand of peace hath touchd whose learning and good letters peace hath tutord whose white investments figure innocence the dove and very blessed spirit of peace wherefore you do so ill translate yourself out of the speech of peace that bears such grace into the harsh and boistrous tongue of war turning your books to graves your ink to blood your pens to lances and your tongue divine to a loud trumpet and a point of war archbishop wherefore do i this so the question stands briefly to this end we are all diseasd and with our surfeiting and wanton hours have brought ourselves into a burning fever and we must bleed for it of which disease our late king richard being infected died but my most noble lord of westmoreland i take not on me here as a physician nor do i as an enemy to peace troop in the throngs of military men but rather show awhile like fearful war to diet rank minds sick of happiness and purge th obstructions which begin to stop our very veins of life hear me more plainly i have in equal balance justly weighd what wrongs our arms may do what wrongs we suffer and find our griefs heavier than our offences we see which way the stream of time doth run and are enforcd from our most quiet there by the rough torrent of occasion and have the summary of all our griefs when time shall serve to show in articles which long ere this we offerd to the king and might by no suit gain our audience when we are wrongd and would unfold our griefs we are denied access unto his person even by those men that most have done us wrong the dangers of the days but newly gone whose memory is written on the earth with yet appearing blood and the examples of every minutes instance present now hath put us in these illbeseeming arms not to break peace or any branch of it but to establish here a peace indeed concurring both in name and quality westmoreland when ever yet was your appeal denied wherein have you been galled by the king what peer hath been subornd to grate on you that you should seal this lawless bloody book of forgd rebellion with a seal divine and consecrate commotions bitter edge archbishop my brother general the commonwealth to brother horn an household cruelty i make my quarrel in particular westmoreland there is no need of any such redress or if there were it not belongs to you mowbray why not to him in part and to us all that feel the bruises of the days before and suffer the condition of these times to lay a heavy and unequal hand upon our honours westmoreland o my good lord mowbray construe the times to their necessities and you shall say indeed it is the time and not the king that doth you injuries yet for your part it not appears to me either from the king or in the present time that you should have an inch of any ground to build a grief on were you not restord to all the duke of norfolks signiories your noble and right wellremembred fathers mowbray what thing in honour had my father lost that need to be revivd and breathd in me the king that lovd him as the state stood then was force perforce compelld to banish him and then that henry bolingbroke and he being mounted and both roused in their seats their neighing coursers daring of the spur their armed staves in charge their beavers down their eyes of fire sparkling through sights of steel and the loud trumpet blowing them together then then when there was nothing could have stayd my father from the breast of bolingbroke o when the king did throw his warder down his own life hung upon the staff he threw then threw he down himself and all their lives that by indictment and by dint of sword have since miscarried under bolingbroke westmoreland you speak lord mowbray now you know not what the earl of hereford was reputed then in england the most valiant gentleman who knows on whom fortune would then have smild but if your father had been victor there he neer had borne it out of coventry for all the country in a general voice cried hate upon him and all their prayers and love were set on hereford whom they doted on and blessd and gracd indeed more than the king but this is mere digression from my purpose here come i from our princely general to know your griefs to tell you from his grace that he will give you audience and wherein it shall appear that your demands are just you shall enjoy them everything set off that might so much as think you enemies mowbray but he hath forcd us to compel this offer and it proceeds from policy not love westmoreland mowbray you overween to take it so this offer comes from mercy not from fear for lo within a ken our army lies upon mine honour all too confident to give admittance to a thought of fear our battle is more full of names than yours our men more perfect in the use of arms our armour all as strong our cause the best then reason will our hearts should be as good say you not then our offer is compelld mowbray well by my will we shall admit no parley westmoreland that argues but the shame of your offence a rotten case abides no handling hastings hath the prince john a full commission in very ample virtue of his father to hear and absolutely to determine of what conditions we shall stand upon westmoreland that is intended in the generals name i muse you make so slight a question archbishop then take my lord of westmoreland this schedule for this contains our general grievances each several article herein redressd all members of our cause both here and hence that are insinewed to this action acquitted by a true substantial form and present execution of our wills to us and to our purposes confind we come within our awful banks again and knit our powers to the arm of peace westmoreland this will i show the general please you lords in sight of both our battles we may meet and either end in peace which god so frame or to the place of diffrence call the swords which must decide it archbishop my lord we will do so exit westmoreland mowbray there is a thing within my bosom tells me that no conditions of our peace can stand hastings fear you not that if we can make our peace upon such large terms and so absolute as our conditions shall consist upon our peace shall stand as firm as rocky mountains mowbray yea but our valuation shall be such that every slight and falsederived cause yea every idle nice and wanton reason shall to the king taste of this action that were our royal faiths martyrs in love we shall be winnowd with so rough a wind that even our corn shall seem as light as chaff and good from bad find no partition archbishop no no my lord note this the king is weary of dainty and such picking grievances for he hath found to end one doubt by death revives two greater in the heirs of life and therefore will he wipe his tables clean and keep no telltale to his memory that may repeat and history his los to new remembrance for full well he knows he cannot so precisely weed this land as his misdoubts present occasion his foes are so enrooted with his friends that plucking to unfix an enemy he doth unfasten so and shake a friend so that this land like an offensive wife that hath enragd him on to offer strokes as he is striking holds his infant up and hangs resolvd correction in the arm that was upreard to execution hastings besides the king hath wasted all his rods on late offenders that he now doth lack the very instruments of chastisement so that his power like to a fangless lion may offer but not hold archbishop tis very true and therefore be assurd my good lord marshal if we do now make our atonement well our peace will like a broken limb united grow stronger for the breaking mowbray be it so here is returnd my lord of westmoreland reenter westmoreland westmoreland the prince is here at hand pleaseth your lordship to meet his grace just distance tween our armies mowbray your grace of york in gods name then set forward archbishop before and greet his

showd with you when that your flock assembled by the bell encircled you to hear with reverence your exposition on the holy text than now to see you here an iron man cheering a rout of rebels with your drum turning the word to sword and life to death that man that sits within a monarchs heart and ripens in the sunshine of his favour would he abuse the countenance of the king alack what mischiefs might he set abroach in shadow of such greatness with you lord bishop it is even so who hath not heard it spoken how deep you were within the books of god to us the speaker in his parliament to us th imagind voice of god himself the very opener and intelligencer between the grace the sanctities of heaven and our dull workings o who shall believe but you misuse the reverence of your place employ the countenance and grace of heavn as a false favourite doth his princes name in deeds dishonourable you have taen up under the counterfeited zeal of god the subjects of his substitute my father and both against the peace of heaven and him have here upswarmd them archbishop good my lord of lancaster i am not here against your fathers peace but as i told my lord of westmoreland the time misordred doth in common sense crowd us and crush us to this monstrous form to hold our safety up i sent your grace the parcels and particulars of our grief the which hath been with scorn shovd from the court whereon this hydra son of war is born whose dangerous eyes may well be charmd asleep with grant of our most just and right desires and true obedience of this madness curd stoop tamely to the foot of majesty mowbray if not we ready are to try our fortunes to the last man hastings and though we here fall down we have supplies to second our attempt if they miscarry theirs shall second them and so success of mischief shall be born and heir from heir shall hold this quarrel up whiles england shall have generation prince john you are too shallow hastings much to shallow to sound the bottom of the aftertimes westmoreland pleaseth your grace to answer them directly how far forth you do like their articles prince john i like them all and do allow them well and swear here by the honour of my blood

thats no marvel he drinks no wine theres never none of these demure boys come to any proof for thin drink doth so overcool their blood and making many fishmeals that they fall into a kind of male greensickness and then when they marry they get wenches they are generally fools and cowardswhich some of us should be too but for inflammation a good sherrissack hath a twofold operation in it it ascends me into the brain dries me there all the foolish and dull and crudy vapours which environ it makes it apprehensive quick forgetive full of nimble fiery and delectable shapes which delivered oer to the voice the tongue which is the birth becomes excellent wit the second property of your excellent sherris is the warming of the blood which before cold and settled left the liver white and pale which is the badge of pusillanimity and cowardice but the sherris warms it and makes it course from the inwards to the parts extremes it illumineth the face which as a beacon gives warning to all the rest of this little kingdom man to arm and then the vital commoners and inland petty spirits muster me all to their captain the heart who great and puffd up with this retinue doth any deed of courage and this valour comes of sherris so that skill in the weapon is nothing without sack for that sets it awork and learning a mere hoard of gold kept by a devil till sack commences it and sets it in act and use hereof comes it that prince harry is valiant for the cold blood he did naturally inherit of his father he hath like lean sterile and bare land manured husbanded and tilld with excellent endeavour of drinking good and good store of fertile sherris that he is become very hot and valiant if i had a thousand sons the first humane principle i would teach them should be to forswear thin potations and to addict themselves to sack enter bardolph how now bardolph bardolph the army is discharged all and gone falstaff let them go ill through gloucestershire and there will i visit master

loves thee and thou dost neglect him thomas thou hast a better place in his affection than all thy brothers cherish it my boy and noble offices thou mayst effect of mediation after i am dead between his greatness and thy other brethren therefore omit him not blunt not his love nor lose the good advantage of his grace by seeming cold or careless of his will for he is gracious if he be observd he hath a tear for pity and a hand open as day for melting charity yet notwithstanding being incensd he is flint as humorous as winter and as sudden as flaws congealed in the spring of day his temper therefore must be well observd chide him for faults and do it reverently when you perceive his blood inclind to mirth but being moody give him line and scope till that his passions like a whale on ground confound themselves with working learn this thomas and thou shalt prove a shelter to thy friends a hoop of gold to bind thy brothers in that the united vessel of their blood mingled with venom

when means and lavish manners meet together o with what wings shall his affections fly towards fronting peril and opposd decay warwick my gracious lord you look beyond him quite the prince but studies his companions like a strange tongue wherein to gain the language tis needful that the most immodest word be lookd upon and learnt which once attaind your highness knows comes to no further use but to be known and hated so like gross terms the prince will in the perfectness of time cast off his followers and their memory shall as a pattern or a measure live by which his grace must mete the lives of

when gold becomes her object for this the foolish overcareful fathers have broke their sleep with thoughts their brains with care their bones with industry for this they have engrossed and pild up the cankred heaps of strangeachieved gold for this they have been thoughtful to invest their sons with arts and martial exercises when like the bee tolling from every flower the virtuous sweets our thighs with wax our mouths with honey packd we bring it to the hive and like the bees are murdred for our pains this bitter taste yields his engrossments to the ending father reenter warwick now where is he

the greatness that will overwhelm thee stay but a little for my cloud of dignity is held from falling with so weak a wind that it will quickly drop my day is dim thou hast stoln that which after some few hours were thine without offense and at my death thou hast seald up my expectation thy life did manifest thou lovdst me not and thou wilt have me die assurd of it thou hidst a thousand daggers in thy thoughts which thou hast whetted on thy stony heart to stab at half an hour of my life what canst thou not forbear me half an hour then get thee gone and dig my grave thyself and bid the merry bells ring to thine ear that thou art crowned not that i am dead let all the tears that should bedew my hearse be drops of balm to sanctify thy head only compound me with forgotten dust give that which gave thee life unto the worms pluck down my officers break my decrees for now a time is come to mock at form harry the fifth is crownd up vanity down royal state all you sage counsellors hence and to the english court assemble now from every region apes of idleness now neighbour confines purge you of your scum have you a ruffian that will swear drink dance revel the night rob murder and

license plucks the muzzle of restraint and the wild dog shall flesh his tooth on every innocent o my poor kingdom sick with civil blows when that my care could not withhold thy riots what wilt thou do when riot is thy care o thou wilt be a wilderness again peopled with wolves thy old inhabitants prince o pardon me my liege but for my tears the moist impediments unto my speech i had forestalld this dear and deep rebuke ere you with grief had spoke and i had heard the course of it so far there is your crown and he that wears the crown immortally long guard it yours kneeling if i affect it more than as your honour and as your renown let me no more from this obedience rise which my most inward true and duteous spirit teacheth this prostrate and exterior bending god witness with me when i here came in and found no course of breath within your majesty how cold it struck my heart if i do feign o let me in my present wildness die and never live to show th incredulous world the noble change that i have purposed coming to look on you thinking you dead and dead almost my liege to think you were i spake unto this crown as having sense and thus upbraided it the care on thee depending hath fed upon the body of my father therefore thou best of gold art worst of gold other less fine in carat is more precious preserving life in medcine potable but thou most fine most honourd most renownd hast eat thy bearer up thus my most royal liege accusing it i put it on my head to try with it as with an enemy that had before my face murdred my father the quarrel of a true inheritor but if it did infect my blood with joy or swell my thoughts to any strain of pride if any rebel or vain spirit of mine did with the least affection of a welcome give entertainment to the might of it let god for ever keep it from my head and make me as the poorest vassal is that doth with awe and terror kneel to it king o my son god put it in thy mind to take it hence that thou mightst win the more thy fathers love pleading so wisely in excuse of it come hither harry sit thou by my bed and hear i think the very latest counsel that ever i shall breathe god knows my son by what bypaths and indirect crookd ways i met this crown and i myself know well how troublesome it sat upon my head to thee it shall descend with better quiet better opinion better confirmation for all the soil of the achievement goes with me into the earth it seemd in me but as an honour snatchd with boistrous hand and i had many living to upbraid my gain of it by their assistances which daily grew to quarrel and to bloodshed wounding supposed peace all these bold fears thou seest with peril i have answered for all my reign hath been but as a scene acting that argument and now my death changes the mood for what in me was purchasd falls upon thee in a more fairer sort so thou the garland wearst successively yet though thou standst more sure than i could do thou art not firm enough since griefs are green and all my friends which thou must make thy friends have but their stings and teeth newly taen out by whose fell working i was first advancd and by whose power i well might lodge a fear to be again displacd which to avoid i cut them off and had a purpose now to lead out many to the holy land lest rest and lying still might make them look too near unto my state therefore my harry be it thy course to busy giddy minds with foreign quarrels that action hence borne out may waste the memory of the former days more would i but my lungs are wasted so that strength of speech is utterly denied me how i came by the crown o god forgive and grant it may with thee in true peace live prince my gracious liege you won it wore it kept it gave it me then plain and right must my possession be which i with more than with a common pain gainst all the world will rightfully maintain enter prince john of lancaster warwick lords and others king look look here comes my john of lancaster prince john health

the participation of society that they flock together in consent like so many wild geese if i had a suit to master shallow i would humour his men with the imputation of being near their master if to his men i would curry with master shallow that no man could better command his servants it is certain that either wise bearing or ignorant carriage is caught as men take diseases one of another

to forget my place the majesty and power of law and justice the image of the king whom i presented and struck me in my very seat of judgment whereon as an offender to your father i gave bold way to my authority and did commit you if the deed were ill be you contented wearing now the garland to have a son set your decrees at nought to pluck down justice from your awful bench to trip the course of

in her smock till she have writ a sheet of paper my daughter tells us all claud now you talk of a sheet of paper i remember a pretty jest your daughter told us of leon o when she had writ it and was reading it over she found benedick and beatrice between the sheet claud that leon o she tore the letter into a thousand halfpence raild at herself that she should be so immodest to write to one that she knew would flout her i measure him says she by my own spirit for i should flout him if he writ to me yea though i love him i should claud then down upon her knees she falls weeps sobs beats her heart tears her hair prays curseso sweet benedick god give me patience leon she doth indeed my daughter says so and the ecstasy hath so much overborne her that my daughter is sometime afeard she will do a desperate outrage to herself it is very true pedro it were good that benedick knew of it by some other if she will not discover it claud to what end he would make but a sport of it and torment the poor lady worse pedro an he should it were an alms to hang him shes an excellent sweet lady and out of all suspicion she is virtuous claud and she is exceeding wise pedro in everything but in loving benedick leon o my lord wisdom and blood combating in so tender a body we have ten proofs to one that blood hath the victory i am sorry for her as i have just cause being her uncle and her guardian pedro i would she had bestowed this dotage on me i would have daffd all other respects and made her half myself i pray you tell benedick of it and hear what a will say leon were it good think you claud hero thinks surely she will die for she says she will die if he love her not and she will die ere she make her love known and she will die if he woo her rather than she will bate one breath of her accustomed crossness pedro she doth well if she should make tender of her love tis very possible hell scorn it for the man as you know all hath a contemptible spirit claud he is a very proper man pedro he hath indeed a good outward happiness claud before god and in my mind very wise pedro he doth indeed show some sparks that are like wit claud and i take him to be valiant pedro as hector i assure you and in the managing of quarrels you may say he is wise for either he avoids them with great discretion or undertakes them with a most christianlike fear leon if he do fear god a must necessarily keep peace if he break the peace he ought to enter into a quarrel with fear and trembling pedro and so will he do for the man doth fear god howsoever it seems not in him by some large jests he will make well i am sorry for your niece shall we go seek benedick and tell him of her love claud never tell him my lord let her wear it out with good counsel leon nay thats impossible she may wear her heart out first pedro well we will hear further of it by your daughter let it cool the while i love benedick well and i could wish he would modestly examine himself to see how much he is unworthy so good a lady leon my lord will you walk dinner is ready they walk away claud if he dote on her upon this i will never trust my expectation pedro let there be the same net spread for her and that must your daughter and her gentlewomen carry the sport will be when they hold one an opinion of anothers dotage and no such matter thats the scene that i would see which will be merely a dumb show let us send her to call him in to dinner exeunt don pedro claudio and leonato benedick advances from the arbour bene this can be no trick the conference was sadly borne they have the truth of this from hero they seem to pity the lady it seems her affections have their full bent love me why it must be requited i hear how i am censurd they say i will bear myself proudly if i perceive the love come from her they say too that she will rather die than give any sign of affection i did never think to marry i must not seem proud happy are they that hear their detractions and can put them to mending they say the lady is fairtis a truth i can bear them witness and virtuous tis so i cannot reprove it and wise but for loving meby my troth it is no addition to her wit nor no great argument of her folly for i will be horribly in love with her i may chance have some odd quirks and remnants of wit broken on me because i have railed so long against marriage but doth not the appetite alters a man loves the meat in his youth that he cannot endure in his age shall quips and sentences and these paper bullets of the brain awe a man from the career of his humour no the world must be peopled when i said i would die a bachelor i did not think i should live till i were married enter beatrice here comes beatrice by this day shes a fair lady i do spy some marks of love in her beat against my will i am sent to bid you come in to dinner bene fair beatrice i thank you for your pains beat i took no more pains for those thanks than you take pains to thank me if it had been painful i would not have come bene you take pleasure then in the message beat yea just so much as you may take upon a knives point and choke a daw withal you have no stomach signior fare you well exit bene ha against my will i am sent to bid you come in to dinner theres a double meaning in that i took no more pains for those thanks than you took pains to thank me thats as much as to say any pains that i take for you is as easy as thanks if i do not take pity of her i am a villain if i do not love her i am a jew i will go get her picture exit act iii scene i leonatos orchard enter hero and two gentlewomen margaret and ursula hero good margaret run thee to the parlour there shalt thou find my cousin beatrice proposing with the prince and claudio whisper her ear and tell her i and ursley walk in the orchard and our whole discourse is all of her say that thou overheardst us and bid her steal into the pleached bower where honeysuckles ripened by the sun forbid the sun to enterlike favourites made proud by princes that advance their pride against that power that bred it there will she hide her to listen our propose this is thy office bear thee well in it and leave us alone marg ill make her come i warrant you presently exit hero now ursula when beatrice doth come as we do trace this alley up and down our talk must only be of benedick when i do name him let it be thy part to praise him more than ever man did merit my talk to thee must be how benedick is sick in love with beatrice of this matter is little cupids crafty arrow made that only wounds by hearsay enter beatrice now begin for look where beatrice like a lapwing runs close by the ground to hear our conference beatrice hides in the arbour urs the pleasantst angling is to see the fish cut with her golden oars the silver stream and greedily devour the treacherous bait so angle we for beatrice who even now is couched in the woodbine coverture fear you not my part of the dialogue hero then go we near her that her ear lose nothing of the false sweet bait that we lay for it they approach the arbour no truly ursula she is too disdainful i know her spirits are as coy and wild as haggards of the rock urs but are you sure that benedick loves beatrice so entirely hero so says the prince and my newtrothed lord urs and did they bid you tell her of it madam hero they did entreat me to acquaint her of it but i persuaded them if they lovd benedick to wish him wrestle with affection and never to let beatrice know of it urs why did you so doth not the gentleman deserve as full as fortunate a bed as ever beatrice shall couch upon hero o god of love i know he doth deserve as much as may be yielded to a man but nature never framd a womans heart of prouder stuff than that of beatrice disdain and scorn ride sparkling in her eyes misprizing what they look on and her wit values itself so highly that to her all matter else seems weak she cannot love nor take no shape nor project of affection she is so selfendeared urs sure i think so and therefore certainly it were not good she knew his love lest shell make sport at it hero why you speak truth i never yet saw man how wise how noble young how rarely featurd but she would spell him backward if fairfacd she would swear the gentleman should be her sister if black why nature drawing of an antic made a foul blot if tall a lance illheaded if low an agate very vilely cut if speaking why a vane blown with all winds if silent why a block moved with none so turns she every man the wrong side out and never gives to truth and virtue that which simpleness and merit purchaseth urs sure sure such carping is not commendable hero no not to be so odd and from all fashions as beatrice is cannot be commendable but who dare tell her so if i should speak she would mock me into air o she would laugh me out of myself press me to death with wit therefore let benedick like coverd fire consume away in sighs waste inwardly it were a better death than die with mocks which is as bad as die with tickling urs yet tell her of it hear what she will say hero no rather i will go to benedick and counsel him to fight against his passion and truly ill devise some honest slanders to stain my cousin with one doth not know how much an ill word may empoison liking urs o do not do your cousin such a wrong she cannot be so much without true judgment having so swift and excellent a wit as she is prizd to have as to refuse so rare a gentleman as signior benedick hero he is the only man of italy always excepted my dear claudio urs i pray you be not angry with me madam speaking my fancy signior benedick for shape for bearing argument and valour goes foremost in report through italy hero indeed he hath an excellent good name urs his excellence did earn it ere he had it when are you married madam hero why every day tomorrow come go in ill show thee some attires and have thy counsel which is the best to furnish me tomorrow they walk away urs shes limd i warrant you we have caught her madam hero if it prove so then loving goes by haps some cupid kills with arrows some with traps exeunt hero and ursula beatrice advances from the arbour beat what fire is in mine ears can this be

rest of the watch together and thank god you are rid of a knave verg if he will not stand when he is bidden he is none of the princes subjects dog true and they are to meddle with none but the princes subjects you shall also make no noise in the streets for for the watch to babble and to talk is most tolerable and not to be endured watch we will rather sleep than talk we know what belongs to a watch dog why you speak like an ancient and most quiet watchman for i cannot see how sleeping should offend only have a care that your bills be not stoln well you are to call at all the alehouses and

any honesty in him verg if you hear a child cry in the night you must call to the nurse and bid her still it watch how if the nurse be asleep and will not hear us dog why then depart in peace and let

present the princes own person if you meet the prince in the night you may stay him verg nay byr lady that i think a cannot dog five shillings to one ont with any man that knows the statutes he may stay him marry not without the prince be willing for indeed the watch ought to offend no man and it is an offence to stay a man against his will verg byr lady i think it be so dog ha ah ha well

villain confessd the vile encounters they have had a thousand times in secret john fie fie they are not to be namd my lord not to be spoke of there is not chastity enough in language without offence to utter them thus pretty lady i am sorry for thy much misgovernment claud o hero what a hero hadst thou been if half thy outward graces had been placd about thy thoughts and counsels of thy heart but fare thee well most foul most fair farewell thou pure impiety and impious purity for thee ill lock up all the gates of love and on my eyelids shall conjecture hang to turn all beauty into thoughts of

every earthly thing cry shame upon her could she here deny the story that is printed in her blood do not live hero do not ope thine eyes for did i think thou wouldst not quickly die thought i thy spirits were stronger than thy shames myself would on the rearward of reproaches strike at thy life grievd i i had but one child i for that at frugal natures frame o one too much by thee why had i one why ever wast thou lovely in my eyes why had i not with charitable hand took up a beggars issue at my gates who smirched thus and mird with infamy i might have said no part of it is mine this shame derives itself from unknown loins but mine and mine i lovd and mine i praisd and mine that i was proud onmine so much that i myself was to myself not mine valuing of herwhy she o she is falln into a pit of ink that the wide sea hath drops too few to wash her clean again and salt too little which may season give to her foul tainted flesh bene sir sir be patient for my part i am so attird in wonder i know not what to say beat o on my soul my cousin is belied bene lady were you her bedfellow last night beat no truly not although until last night i have this twelvemonth been her bedfellow leon confirmd confirmd o that is stronger made which was before barrd up with ribs of iron would the two princes lie and claudio lie who lovd her so that speaking of her foulness washd it with tears hence from her let her die friar hear me a little for i have only been silent so long and given way unto this course of fortune by noting of the lady i have markd a thousand blushing apparitions to start into her face a thousand innocent shames in angel whiteness beat away those blushes and in her eye there hath appeard a fire to burn the errors that these princes hold against her maiden truth call me a fool trust not my reading nor my observation which with experimental seal doth warrant the tenure of my book trust not my age my reverence calling nor divinity if this sweet lady lie not guiltless here under some biting error leon friar it cannot be thou seest that all the grace that she hath left is that she will not add to her damnation a sin of perjury she not denies it why seekst thou then to cover with excuse that which appears in proper nakedness friar lady what man is he you are accusd of hero they know that do accuse me i know none if i know more of any man alive than that which maiden modesty doth warrant let all my sins lack mercy o my father prove you that any man with me conversd at hours unmeet or that i yesternight maintaind the change of words with any creature refuse me hate me torture me to death friar there is some strange misprision in the princes bene two of them have the very bent of honour and if their wisdoms be misled in this the practice of it lives in john the bastard whose spirits toil in frame of villanies leon i know not if they speak but truth of her these hands shall tear her if they wrong her honour the proudest of them shall well hear of it time hath not yet so dried this blood of mine nor age so eat up my invention nor fortune made such havoc of my means nor my bad life reft me so much of friends but they shall find awakd in such a kind both strength of limb and policy of mind ability in means and choice of friends to quit me of them throughly friar pause awhile and let my counsel sway you in this case your daughter here the princes left for dead let her awhile be secretly kept in and publish it that she is dead indeed maintain a mourning ostentation and on your familys old monument hang mournful epitaphs and do all rites that appertain unto a burial leon what shall become of this what will this do friar marry this well carried shall on her behalf change slander to remorse that is some good but not for that dream i on this strange course but on this travail look for greater birth she dying as it must be so maintaind upon the instant that she was accusd shall be lamented pitied and excusd of every hearer for it so falls out that what we have we prize not to the worth whiles we enjoy it but being lackd and lost why then we rack the value then we find the virtue that possession would not show us whiles it was ours so will it fare with claudio when he shall hear she died upon his words th idea of her life shall sweetly creep into his study of imagination and every lovely organ of her life shall come apparelld in more precious habit more moving delicate and full of life into the eye and prospect of his soul than when she livd indeed then shall he mourn if ever love had interest in his liver and wish he had not so accused her no though be thought his accusation true let this be so and doubt not but success will fashion the event in better shape than i can lay it down in likelihood but if all aim but this be levelld false the supposition of the ladys death will quench the wonder of her infamy and if it sort not well you may conceal her as best befits her wounded reputation in some reclusive and religious life out of all eyes tongues minds and injuries bene signior leonato let the friar advise you and though you know my inwardness and love is very much unto the prince and claudio yet by mine honour i will deal in this as secretly and justly as your soul should with your body leon being that i flow in grief the smallest twine may lead me friar tis well consented presently away for to strange sores strangely they strain the cure come lady die to live this wedding day perhaps is but prolongd have patience and endure exeunt all but benedick and beatrice bene lady beatrice have you wept all this while beat yea and i will weep a while longer bene i will not desire that beat you have no reason i do it freely bene surely i do believe your fair cousin is wronged beat ah how much might the man deserve of me that would right her bene is there any way to show such friendship beat a very even way but no such friend bene may a man do it beat it is a mans office but not yours bene i do love nothing in the world so well as you is not that strange beat as strange as the thing i know not it were as possible for me to say i loved nothing so well as you but believe me not and yet i lie not i confess nothing nor i deny nothing i am sorry for my cousin bene by my sword beatrice thou lovest me beat do not swear and eat it bene i will swear by it that you love me and i will make him eat it that says i love not you beat will you not eat your word bene with no sauce that can be devised to it i protest i love thee beat why then god forgive me bene what offence sweet beatrice beat you have stayed me in a happy hour i was about to protest i loved you bene and do it with all thy heart beat i love you with so much of my heart that none is left to protest bene come bid me do anything for thee beat kill claudio bene ha not for the wide world beat you kill me to deny it farewell bene tarry sweet beatrice beat i am gone though i am here there is no love in you nay i pray you let me go bene beatrice beat in faith i will go bene well be friends first beat you dare easier be friends with me than fight with mine enemy bene is claudio thine enemy beat is a not approved in the height a villain that hath slandered scorned dishonoured my kinswoman o that i were a man what bear her in hand until they come to take hands and then with public accusation uncoverd slander unmitigated rancouro god that i were a man i would eat his heart in the market place bene hear me beatrice beat talk with a man out at a windowa proper saying bene nay but beatrice beat sweet hero she is wrongd she is slandred she is undone bene beat beat princes and counties surely a princely testimony a goodly count count comfect a sweet gallant surely o that i were a man for his sake or that i had any friend would be a man for my sake but manhood is melted into cursies valour into compliment and men are only turnd into tongue and trim ones too he is now as valiant as hercules that only tells a lieand swears it i cannot be a man with wishing therefore i will die a woman with grieving bene tarry good beatrice by this hand i love thee beat use it for my love some other way than swearing by it bene think you in your soul the count claudio hath wrongd hero beat yea as sure is i have a thought or a soul bene enough i am engagd i will challenge him i will kiss your hand and so i leave you by

wars upon me and their contestation was theme for you you were the word of war antony you do mistake your business my brother never did urge me in his act i did inquire it and have my learning from some true reports that drew their swords with you did he not rather discredit my authority with yours and make the wars alike against my stomach having alike your cause of this my letters before did satisfy you if youll patch a quarrel as matter whole you have not to make it with it must not be with this caesar you praise yourself by laying defects of judgment to me but you patchd up your excuses antony not so not so i know you could not lack i am certain ont very necessity of this thought that i your partner in the cause gainst which he fought could not with graceful eyes attend those wars

for thine honest care which to requite command me while i live this love of theirs myself have often seen haply when they have judgd me fast asleep and oftentimes have purposd to forbid sir valentine

valentine is banishd from her sight thurio since his exile she hath despisd me most forsworn my company and raild at me that i am desperate of obtaining her duke this weak impress of love is as a figure trenched in ice which with an hours heat dissolves to water and doth lose his form a little time will melt her frozen thoughts and worthless valentine shall be forgot enter proteus how now sir proteus is your countryman according to our proclamation gone proteus gone my good lord duke my daughter takes his going grievously proteus a little time my lord will kill that grief duke so i believe but thurio thinks not so proteus the good conceit i hold of thee for thou hast shown some sign of good desert makes me the better to confer with thee proteus longer than i prove loyal to your grace let me not live to look upon your grace duke thou knowst how willingly i would effect the match between sir thurio and my daughter proteus i do my lord duke and also i think thou art not ignorant how she opposes her against my will proteus she did my lord when valentine was here duke ay and perversely she persevers so what might we do to make the girl forget the love of valentine and love sir

his enemy deliver it therefore it must with circumstance be spoken by one whom she esteemeth as his friend duke then you must undertake to slander him proteus and that my lord i shall be loath to do

by praising me as much as you in worth dispraise sir valentine duke and proteus we dare trust you in this kind because we know on valentines report you are already loves firm votary and cannot soon revolt and change your mind upon this warrant shall you have access where you with silvia may confer at large for she is lumpish heavy melancholy and for your friends sake will be glad of you where

desires by wailful sonnets whose composed rhymes should be fullfraught with serviceable vows duke ay much is the force of heavenbred poesy proteus say that upon the altar of her beauty you sacrifice

up twenty times a night and there will she sit in her smock till she have writ a sheet of paper my daughter tells us all claud now you talk of a sheet of paper i remember a pretty jest your daughter told us of leon o when she had writ it and was reading it over she found benedick and beatrice between the sheet claud that leon o she tore the letter into a thousand halfpence raild at herself that she should be so immodest to write to one that she knew would flout her i measure him says she by my own spirit for i should flout him if he writ to me yea though i love him i should claud then down upon her knees she falls weeps sobs beats her heart tears her hair prays curseso sweet benedick god give me patience leon she doth indeed my daughter says so and the ecstasy hath so much overborne her that my daughter is sometime afeard she will do a desperate outrage to herself it is very true pedro it were good that benedick knew of it by some other if she will not discover it claud to what end he would make but a sport of it and torment the poor lady worse pedro an he should it were an alms to hang him shes an excellent sweet lady and out of all suspicion she is virtuous claud and she is exceeding wise pedro in everything but in loving benedick leon o my lord wisdom and blood combating in so tender a body we have ten proofs to one that blood hath the victory i am sorry for her as i have just cause being her uncle and her guardian pedro i would she had bestowed this dotage on me i would have daffd all other respects and made her half myself i pray you tell benedick of it and hear what a will say leon were it good think you claud hero thinks surely she will die for she says she will die if he love her not and she will die ere she make her love known and she will die if he woo her rather than she will bate one breath of her accustomed crossness pedro she doth well if she should make tender of her love tis very possible hell scorn it for the man as you know all hath a contemptible spirit claud he is a very proper man pedro he hath indeed a good outward happiness claud before god and in my mind very wise pedro he doth indeed show some sparks that are like wit claud and i take him to be valiant pedro as hector i assure you and in the managing of quarrels you may say he is wise for either he avoids them with great discretion or undertakes them with a most christianlike fear leon if he do fear god a must necessarily keep peace if he break the peace he ought to enter into a quarrel with fear and trembling pedro and so will he do for the man doth fear god howsoever it seems not in him by some large jests he will make well i am sorry for your niece shall we go seek benedick and tell him of her love claud never tell him my lord let her wear it out with good counsel leon nay thats impossible she may wear her heart out first pedro well we will hear further of it by your daughter let it cool the while i love benedick well and i could wish he would modestly examine himself to see how much he is unworthy so good a lady leon my lord will you walk dinner is ready they walk away claud if he dote on her upon this i will never trust my expectation pedro let there be the same net spread for her and that must your daughter and her gentlewomen carry the sport will be when they hold one an opinion of anothers dotage and no such matter thats the scene that i would see which will be merely a dumb show let us send her to call him in to dinner exeunt don pedro claudio and leonato benedick advances from the arbour bene this can be no trick the conference was sadly borne they have the truth of this from hero they seem to pity the lady it seems her affections have their full bent love me why it must be requited i hear how i am censurd they say i will bear myself proudly if i perceive the love come from her they say too that she will rather die than give any sign of affection i did never think to marry i must not seem proud happy are they that hear their detractions and can put them to mending they say the lady is fairtis a truth i can bear them witness and virtuous tis so i cannot reprove it and wise but for loving meby my troth it is no addition to her wit nor no great argument of her folly for i will be horribly in love with her i may chance have some odd quirks and remnants of wit broken on me because i have railed so long against marriage but doth not the appetite alters a man loves the meat in his youth that he cannot endure in his age shall quips and sentences and these paper bullets of the brain awe a man from the career of his humour no the world must be peopled when i said i would die a bachelor i did not think i should live till i were married enter beatrice here comes beatrice by this day shes a fair lady i do spy some marks of love in her beat against my will i am sent to bid you come in to dinner bene fair beatrice i thank you for your pains beat i took no more pains for those thanks than you take pains to thank me if it had been painful i would not have come bene you take pleasure then in the message beat yea just so much as you may take upon a knives point and choke a daw withal you have no stomach signior fare you well exit bene ha against my will i am sent to bid you come in to dinner theres a double meaning in that i took no more pains for those thanks than you took pains to thank me thats as much as to say any pains that i take for you is as easy as thanks if i do not take pity of her i am a villain if i do not love her i am a jew i will go get her picture exit act iii scene i leonatos orchard enter hero and two gentlewomen margaret and ursula hero good margaret run thee to the parlour there shalt thou find my cousin beatrice proposing with the prince and claudio whisper her ear and tell her i and ursley walk in the orchard and our whole discourse is all of her say that thou overheardst us and bid her steal into the pleached bower where honeysuckles ripened by the sun forbid the sun to enterlike favourites made proud by princes that advance their pride against that power that bred it there will she hide her to listen our propose this is thy office bear thee well in it and leave us alone marg ill make her come i warrant you presently exit hero now ursula when beatrice doth come as we do trace this alley up and down our talk must only be of benedick when i do name him let it be thy part to praise him more than ever man did merit my talk to thee must be how benedick is sick in love with beatrice of this matter is little cupids crafty arrow made that only wounds by hearsay enter beatrice now begin for look where beatrice like a lapwing runs close by the ground to hear our conference beatrice hides in the arbour urs the pleasantst angling is to see the fish cut with her golden oars the silver stream and greedily devour the treacherous bait so angle we for beatrice who even now is couched in the woodbine coverture fear you not my part of the dialogue hero then go we near her that her ear lose nothing of the false sweet bait that we lay for it they approach the arbour no truly ursula she is too disdainful i know her spirits are as coy and wild as haggards of the rock urs but are you sure that benedick loves beatrice so entirely hero so says the prince and my newtrothed lord urs and did they bid you tell her of it madam hero they did entreat me to acquaint her of it but i persuaded them if they lovd benedick to wish him wrestle with affection and never to let beatrice know of it urs why did you so doth not the gentleman deserve as full as fortunate a bed as ever beatrice shall couch upon hero o god of love i know he doth deserve as much as may be yielded to a man but nature never framd a womans heart of prouder stuff than that of beatrice disdain and scorn ride sparkling in her eyes misprizing what they look on and her wit values itself so highly that to her all matter else seems weak she cannot love nor take no shape nor project of affection she is so selfendeared urs sure i think so and therefore certainly it were not good she knew his love lest shell make sport at it hero why you speak truth i never yet saw man how wise how noble young how rarely featurd but she would spell him backward if fairfacd she would swear the gentleman should be her sister if black why nature drawing of an antic made a foul blot if tall a lance illheaded if low an agate very vilely cut if speaking why a vane blown with all winds if silent why a block moved with none so turns she every man the wrong side out and never gives to truth and virtue that which simpleness and merit purchaseth urs sure sure such carping is not commendable hero no not to be so odd and from all fashions as beatrice is cannot be commendable but who dare tell her so if i should speak she would mock me into air o she would laugh me out of myself press me to death with wit therefore let benedick like coverd fire consume away in sighs waste inwardly it were a better death than die with mocks which is as bad as die with tickling urs yet tell her of it hear what she will say hero no rather i will go to benedick and counsel him to fight against his passion and truly ill devise some honest slanders to stain my cousin with one doth not know how much an ill word may empoison liking urs o do not do your cousin such a wrong she cannot be so much without true judgment having so swift and excellent a wit as she is prizd to have as to refuse so rare a gentleman as signior benedick hero he is the only man of italy always excepted my dear claudio urs i pray you be not angry with me madam speaking my fancy signior benedick for shape for bearing argument and valour goes foremost in report through italy hero indeed he hath an excellent good name urs his excellence did earn it ere he had it when are you married madam hero why every day tomorrow come go in ill show thee some attires and have thy counsel which is the best to furnish me tomorrow they walk away urs shes limd i warrant you we have caught her madam hero if it prove so then loving goes by haps some cupid kills with arrows some with traps exeunt hero and ursula beatrice advances from the arbour beat what fire is in mine ears can this be true stand i condemnd for pride and scorn so much contempt farewell and maiden pride adieu no glory lives behind the back of such and benedick love on i will requite thee taming my wild heart to thy loving hand if thou dost love my kindness shall incite thee to bind our loves up in a holy band for others say thou dost deserve and i believe it better than reportingly exit scene ii a room in leonatos house enter don pedro claudio benedick and leonato pedro i do but stay till your marriage be consummate and then go i toward arragon claud ill bring you thither my lord if youll vouchsafe me pedro nay that would be as great a soil in the new gloss of your marriage as to show a child his new coat and forbid him to wear it i will only be bold with benedick for his company for from the crown of his head to the sole of his foot he is all mirth he hath twice or thrice cut cupids bowstring and the little hangman dare not shoot at him he hath a heart as sound as a bell and his tongue is the clapper for what his heart thinks his tongue speaks bene gallants i am not as i have been leon so say i methinks you are sadder claud i hope he be in love pedro hang him truant theres no true drop of blood in him to be truly touchd with love if he be sad he wants money bene i have the toothache pedro draw it bene hang it claud you must hang it first and draw it afterwards pedro what sigh for the toothache leon where is but a humour or a worm bene well every one can master a grief but he that has it claud yet say i he is in love pedro there is no appearance of fancy in him unless it be a fancy that he hath to strange disguises as to be a dutchman today a frenchman tomorrow or in the shape of two countries at once as a german from the waist downward all slops and a spaniard from the hip upward no doublet unless he have a fancy to this foolery as it appears he hath he is no fool for fancy as you would have it appear he is claud if he be not in love with some woman there is no believing old signs a brushes his hat o mornings what should that bode pedro hath any man seen him at the barbers claud no but the barbers man hath been seen with him and the old ornament of his cheek hath already stuffd tennis balls leon indeed he looks younger than he did by the loss of a beard pedro nay a rubs himself with civet can you smell him out by that claud thats as much as to say the sweet youths in love pedro the greatest note of it is his melancholy claud and when was he wont to wash his face pedro yea or to paint himself for the which i hear what they say of him claud nay but his jesting spirit which is newcrept into a lutestring and now governd by stops pedro indeed that tells a heavy tale for him conclude conclude he is in love claud nay but i know who loves him pedro that would i know too i warrant one that knows him not claud yes and his ill conditions and in despite of all dies for him pedro she shall be buried with her face upwards bene yet is this no charm for the toothache old signior walk aside with me i have studied eight or nine wise words to speak to you which these hobbyhorses must not hear exeunt benedick and leonato pedro for my life to break with him about beatrice claud tis even so hero and margaret have by this played their parts with beatrice and then the two bears will not bite one another when they meet enter john the bastard john my lord and brother god save you pedro good den brother john if your leisure servd i would speak with you pedro in private john if it please you yet count claudio may hear for what i would speak of concerns him pedro whats the matter john to claudio means your lordship to be married tomorrow pedro you know he does john i know not that when he knows what i know claud if there be any impediment i pray you discover it john you may think i love you not let that appear hereafter and aim better at me by that i now will manifest for my brother i think he holds you well and in dearness of heart hath holp to effect your ensuing marriagesurely suit ill spent and labour ill bestowed pedro why whats the matter john i came hither to tell you and circumstances shortned for she has been too long atalking of the lady is disloyal claud who hero john even sheleonatos hero your hero every mans hero claud disloyal john the word is too good to paint out her wickedness i could say she were worse think you of a worse title and i will fit her to it wonder not till further warrant go but with me tonight you shall see her chamber window entred even the night before her wedding day if you love her then tomorrow wed her but it would better fit your honour to change your mind claud may this be so pedro i will not think it john if you dare not trust that you see confess not that you know if you will follow me i will show you enough and when you have seen more and heard more proceed accordingly claud if i see anything tonight why i should not marry her tomorrow in the congregation where i should wed there will i shame her pedro and as i wooed for thee to obtain her i will join with thee to disgrace her john i will disparage her no farther till you are my witnesses bear it coldly but till midnight and let the issue show itself pedro o day untowardly turned claud o mischief strangely thwarting john o plague right well prevented so will you say when you have seen the sequel exeunt scene iii a street enter dogberry and his compartner verges with the watch dog are you good men and true verg yea or else it were pity but they should suffer salvation body and soul dog nay that were a punishment too good for them if they should have any allegiance in them being chosen for the princes watch verg well give them their charge neighbour dogberry dog first who think you the most desartless man to be constable watch hugh oatcake sir or george seacoal for they can write and read dog come hither neighbour seacoal god hath blessd you with a good name to be a wellfavoured man is the gift of fortune but to write and read comes by nature watch both which master constable dog you have i knew it would be your answer well for your favour sir why give god thanks and make no boast of it and for your writing and reading let that appear when there is no need of such vanity you are thought here to be the most senseless and fit man for the constable of the watch therefore bear you the lanthorn this is your charge you shall comprehend all vagrom men you are to bid any man stand in the princes name watch how if a will not stand dog why then take no note of him but let him go and presently call the rest of the watch together and thank god you are rid of a knave verg if he will not stand when he is bidden he is none of the princes subjects dog true and they are to meddle with none but the princes subjects you shall also make no noise in the streets for for the watch to babble and to talk is most tolerable and not to be endured watch we will rather sleep than talk we know what belongs to a watch dog why you speak like an ancient and most quiet watchman for i cannot see how sleeping should offend only have a care that your bills be not stoln well you are to call at all the alehouses and bid those that are drunk get them to bed watch how if they will not dog why then let them alone till they are sober if they make you

not ope thine eyes for did i think thou wouldst not quickly die thought i thy spirits were stronger than thy shames myself would on the rearward of reproaches strike at thy life grievd i i had but one child i for that at frugal natures frame o one too much by thee why had i one why ever wast thou lovely in my eyes why had i not with charitable hand took up a beggars issue at my gates who smirched thus and mird with infamy i might have said no part of it is mine this shame derives itself from unknown loins but mine and mine i lovd and mine i praisd and mine that i was proud onmine so much that i myself was to myself not mine valuing of herwhy she o she is falln into a pit of ink that the wide sea hath drops too few to wash her clean again and salt too little which may season give to her foul tainted flesh bene sir sir be patient for my part i am so attird in wonder i know not what to say beat o on my soul my cousin is belied bene lady were you her bedfellow last night beat no truly not although until last night i have this twelvemonth been her bedfellow leon confirmd confirmd o that is stronger made which was before barrd up with ribs of iron would the two princes lie and claudio lie who lovd her so that speaking of her foulness washd it with tears hence from her let her die friar hear me a little for i have only been silent so long and given way unto this course of fortune by noting of the lady i have markd a thousand blushing apparitions to start into her face a thousand innocent shames in angel whiteness beat away those blushes and in her eye there hath appeard a fire to burn the errors that these princes hold against her maiden truth call me a fool trust not my reading nor my observation which with experimental seal doth warrant the tenure of my book trust not my age my reverence calling nor divinity if this sweet lady lie not guiltless here under some biting error leon friar it cannot be thou seest that all the grace that she hath left is that she will not add to her damnation a sin of perjury she not denies it why seekst thou then to cover with excuse that which appears in proper nakedness friar lady what man is he you are accusd of hero they know that do accuse me i know none if i know more of any man alive than that which maiden modesty doth warrant let all my sins lack mercy o my father prove you that any man with me conversd at hours unmeet or that i yesternight maintaind the change of words with any creature refuse me hate me torture me to death friar there is some strange misprision in the princes bene two of them have the very bent of honour and if their wisdoms be misled in this the practice of it lives in john the bastard whose spirits toil in frame of villanies leon i know not if they speak but truth of her these hands shall tear her if they wrong her honour the proudest of them shall well hear of it time hath not yet so dried this blood of mine nor age so eat up my invention nor fortune made such havoc of my means nor my bad life reft me so much of friends but they shall find awakd in such a kind both strength of limb and policy of mind ability in means and choice of friends to quit me of them throughly friar pause awhile and let my counsel sway you in this case your daughter here the princes left for dead let her awhile be secretly kept in and publish it that she is dead indeed maintain a mourning ostentation and on your familys old monument hang mournful epitaphs and do all rites that appertain unto a burial leon what shall become of this what will this do friar marry this well carried shall on her behalf change slander to remorse that is some good but not for that dream i on this strange course but on this travail look for greater birth she dying as it must be so maintaind upon the instant that she was accusd shall be lamented pitied and excusd of every hearer for it so falls out that what we have we prize not to the worth whiles we enjoy it but being lackd and lost why then we rack the value then we find the virtue that possession would not show us whiles it was ours so will it fare with claudio when he shall hear she died upon his words th idea of her life shall sweetly creep into his study of imagination and every lovely organ of her life shall come apparelld in more precious habit more moving delicate and full of life into the eye and prospect of his soul than when she livd indeed then shall he mourn if ever love had interest in his liver and wish he had not so accused her no though be thought his accusation true let this be so and doubt not but success will fashion the event in better shape than i can lay it down in likelihood but if all aim but this be levelld false the supposition of the ladys death will quench the wonder of her infamy and if it sort not well you may conceal her as best befits her wounded reputation in some reclusive and religious life out of all eyes tongues minds and injuries bene signior leonato let the friar advise you and though you know my inwardness and love is very much unto the prince and claudio yet by mine honour i will deal in this as secretly and justly as your soul should with your body leon being that i flow in grief the smallest twine may lead me friar tis well consented presently away for to strange sores strangely they strain the cure come lady die to live this wedding day perhaps is but

lovest me beat do not swear and eat it bene i will swear by it that you love me and i will make him eat it that says i love not you beat will you not eat your word bene with no sauce that can be devised to it i protest i love thee beat why then god forgive me bene what offence sweet beatrice beat you have stayed me in a happy hour i was about to protest i loved you bene and do it with all thy heart beat i love you with so much of my heart that none is left to protest bene come bid me do anything for thee beat kill claudio bene ha not for the wide world beat you kill me to deny it farewell bene tarry sweet beatrice beat i am gone though i am here there is no love in you nay i pray you let me go bene beatrice beat in faith i will go bene well be friends first beat you dare easier be friends with me than fight with mine enemy bene is claudio thine enemy beat is a not approved in the height a villain that hath slandered scorned dishonoured my kinswoman o that i were a man what bear her in hand until they come to take hands and then with public accusation uncoverd slander unmitigated rancouro god that i were a man i would eat his heart in the market place bene hear me beatrice beat talk with a man out at a windowa proper saying bene nay but beatrice beat sweet hero she is wrongd she is slandred she is undone bene beat beat princes and counties surely a princely testimony a goodly count count comfect a sweet gallant surely o that i were a man for his sake or that i had any friend would be a man for my sake but manhood is melted into cursies valour into compliment and men are only turnd into tongue and trim ones too he is now as valiant as hercules that only tells a lieand swears it i cannot be a man with wishing therefore i will die a woman with grieving bene tarry good beatrice by this hand i love thee beat use it for my love some other way than swearing by it bene think you in your soul the count claudio hath wrongd hero beat yea as sure is i have a thought or

she will die for she says she will die if he love her not and she will die ere she make her love known and she will die if he woo her rather than she will bate one breath of her accustomed crossness pedro she doth well if she should make tender of her love tis very possible hell scorn it for the man as you know all hath a contemptible spirit claud he is a very proper man pedro he hath indeed a good outward happiness claud before god and in my mind very wise pedro he doth indeed show some sparks that are like wit claud and i take him to be valiant pedro as hector i assure you and in the managing of quarrels you may say he is wise for either he avoids them with great discretion or undertakes them with a most christianlike fear leon if he do fear god a must necessarily keep peace if he break the peace he ought to enter into a quarrel with fear and trembling pedro and so will he do for the man doth fear god howsoever it seems not in him by some large jests he will make well i am sorry for your niece shall we go seek benedick and tell him of her love claud never tell him my lord let her wear it out with good counsel leon nay thats impossible she may wear her heart out first

her gentlewomen carry the sport will be when they hold one an opinion of anothers dotage and no such matter thats the scene that i would see which will be merely a dumb show let us send her to call him in to dinner exeunt don pedro claudio and leonato benedick advances from the arbour bene this can be no trick the conference was sadly borne they have the truth of this from hero they seem to pity the lady it seems her affections have their full bent love me why it must be requited i hear how i am censurd they say i will bear myself proudly if i perceive the love come from her they say too that she will rather die than give any sign of affection i did never think to marry i must not seem proud happy are they that hear their detractions and can put them to mending they say the lady is fairtis a truth i can bear them witness and virtuous tis so i cannot reprove it and wise but for loving meby my troth it is no addition to her wit nor no great argument of her folly for i will be horribly in love with her i may chance have some odd quirks and remnants of wit broken on me because i have railed so long against marriage but doth not the appetite alters a man loves the meat in his youth that he cannot endure in his age shall quips and sentences and these paper bullets of the brain awe a man from the career of his humour no the world must be peopled when i said i would die a bachelor i did not think i should live till i were married enter beatrice here comes beatrice by this day shes a fair lady i do spy some marks of love in her beat against my will i am sent to bid you come in to

in the message beat yea just so much as you may take upon a knives point and choke a daw withal you have no stomach signior fare you well exit bene ha against my will i am sent to bid you come in to dinner theres a double meaning in that i took no more pains for those thanks than you took pains to thank me thats as much as to say any pains that i take for you is as easy as thanks if i do not take pity of her i am a villain if i do not love her i am a jew i will go get her picture exit act iii scene i leonatos orchard enter hero and two gentlewomen margaret and ursula hero good margaret run thee to the parlour there shalt thou find my cousin beatrice proposing with the prince and claudio whisper her ear and tell her i and ursley walk in the orchard and our whole discourse is all of her say that thou overheardst us and bid her steal into the pleached bower where honeysuckles ripened by the sun forbid the sun to enterlike favourites made proud by princes that advance their pride against that power that bred it there will she hide her to listen our propose this is thy office bear thee well in it and leave us alone marg ill make her come i warrant you presently exit hero now ursula when beatrice doth come as we do trace this alley up and down our talk must only be of benedick when i do name him let it be thy part to praise him more than ever man did merit my talk to thee must be how benedick is sick in love with beatrice of this matter is little cupids crafty arrow made that only wounds by hearsay enter beatrice now begin for look where beatrice like a lapwing runs close by the ground to hear our conference beatrice hides in the arbour urs the pleasantst angling is to see the fish cut with her golden oars the silver stream and greedily devour the treacherous bait so angle we for beatrice who even now is couched in the woodbine coverture fear you not my part of the dialogue hero then go we near her that her ear lose nothing of the false sweet bait that we lay for it they approach the arbour no truly ursula she is too disdainful i know her spirits are as coy and wild as haggards of the rock urs but are you sure that benedick loves beatrice so entirely hero so says the prince and my newtrothed lord urs and did they bid you tell her of it madam hero they did entreat me to acquaint her of it but i persuaded them if they lovd benedick to wish him wrestle with affection and never to let beatrice know of it urs why did you so doth not the gentleman deserve as full as fortunate a bed as ever beatrice shall couch upon hero o god of love i know he doth deserve as much as may be yielded to a man but nature never framd a womans heart of prouder stuff than that of beatrice disdain and scorn ride sparkling in her eyes misprizing what they look on and her wit values itself so highly that to her all matter else seems weak she cannot love nor take no shape nor project of affection she is so selfendeared urs sure i think so and therefore certainly it were not good she knew his love lest shell make sport at it hero why you speak truth i never yet saw man how wise how noble young how rarely featurd but she would spell him backward if fairfacd she would swear the gentleman should be her sister if black why nature drawing of an antic made a foul blot if tall a lance illheaded if low an agate very vilely cut if speaking why a vane blown with all winds if silent why a block moved with none so turns she every man the wrong side out and never gives to truth and virtue that which simpleness and merit purchaseth urs sure sure such carping is not commendable hero no not to be so odd and from all fashions as beatrice is cannot be commendable but who dare tell her so if i should speak she would mock me into air o she would laugh me out of myself press me to death with wit therefore let benedick like coverd fire consume away in sighs waste inwardly it were a better death than die with mocks which is as bad as die with tickling urs yet tell her of it hear what she will say hero no rather i will go to benedick and counsel him to fight against his passion and truly ill devise some honest slanders to stain my cousin with one doth not know how much an ill word may empoison liking urs o do not do your cousin such a wrong she cannot be so much without true judgment having so swift and excellent a wit as she is prizd to have as to refuse so rare a gentleman as signior benedick hero he is the only man of italy always excepted my dear claudio urs i pray you be not angry with me madam speaking my fancy signior benedick for shape for bearing argument and valour goes foremost in report through italy hero indeed he hath an excellent good name urs his excellence did earn it ere he had it when are you married madam hero why every day tomorrow come go in ill show thee some attires and have thy counsel which is the best to furnish me tomorrow they walk away urs shes limd i warrant you we have caught her madam hero if it prove so then loving goes by haps some cupid kills with arrows some with traps exeunt hero and ursula beatrice advances from the arbour beat what fire is in mine ears can this be true stand i condemnd for pride and scorn so much contempt farewell and maiden pride adieu no glory lives behind the back of such and benedick love on i will requite thee taming my wild heart to thy loving hand if thou dost love my kindness shall incite thee to bind our loves up in a holy band for others say thou dost deserve and i believe it better than reportingly exit scene ii a room in leonatos house enter don pedro claudio benedick

new gloss of your marriage as to show a child his new coat and forbid him to wear it i will only be bold with benedick for his company for from the crown of his head to the sole of his foot he is all mirth he hath twice or thrice cut cupids bowstring and the little hangman dare not shoot at him he hath a heart as sound as a bell and his tongue is the clapper for what his heart thinks his tongue

dutchman today a frenchman tomorrow or in the shape of two countries at once as a german from the waist downward all slops and a spaniard from the hip upward no doublet unless he have a fancy to this foolery as it appears he hath he is no fool for fancy as you would have it appear he is claud if he be not in love with some woman there is no believing old signs a brushes his hat o mornings what should that bode pedro hath any man seen him at the barbers claud no but the barbers man hath been seen with him and the old ornament of his cheek hath already stuffd tennis balls leon indeed he looks younger than he did by the loss of a beard pedro nay a rubs himself with civet can you smell him out by that claud thats as much as to say the sweet youths in love pedro the greatest note of it is his melancholy claud and when was he wont to wash his face pedro yea or to paint himself for the which i hear what they say of him claud nay but his jesting spirit which is newcrept into a lutestring and now governd by stops pedro indeed that tells a heavy tale for him conclude conclude he is in love claud nay but i know who loves him pedro that would i know too i warrant one that knows him not claud

further warrant go but with me tonight you shall see her chamber window entred even the night before her wedding day if you love her then tomorrow wed her but it would better fit your honour to change your mind claud may this be so pedro i will not think it john if you dare not trust that you see confess not that you know if you will follow me i will show you enough and when you have seen more and heard more proceed accordingly claud if i see anything tonight why i should not marry her tomorrow in the congregation where i should wed there will i shame her pedro and as i wooed for thee to obtain

rotten orange to your friend shes but the sign and semblance of her honour behold how like a maid she blushes here o what authority and show of truth can cunning sin cover itself withal comes not that blood as modest evidence to witness simple virtue would you not swear all you that see her that she were a maid by these exterior shows but she is none she knows the heat of a luxurious bed her blush

thy life grievd i i had but one child i for that at frugal natures frame o one too much by thee why had i one why ever wast thou lovely in my eyes why had i not with charitable hand took up a beggars issue at my gates who smirched thus and mird with infamy i might have said no part of it is mine this shame derives itself from unknown loins but mine and mine i lovd and mine i praisd and mine that i was proud onmine so much that i myself was to myself not mine valuing of herwhy she o she is falln into a pit of ink that the wide sea hath drops too few to wash her clean again and salt too little which may season give to her foul tainted flesh bene sir sir be patient for my part i am so attird in wonder i know not what to say beat o on my soul my cousin is belied bene lady were you her bedfellow last night beat no truly not although until last night i have this twelvemonth been her bedfellow leon confirmd confirmd o that is stronger made which was before barrd up with ribs of iron would the two princes lie and claudio lie who lovd her so that speaking of her foulness washd it with tears hence from her let her die friar hear me a little for i have only been silent so long and given way unto this course of fortune by noting of the lady i have markd a thousand blushing apparitions to start into her face a thousand innocent shames in angel whiteness beat away those blushes and in her eye there hath appeard a fire to burn the errors that these princes hold against her maiden truth call me a fool trust not my reading nor my observation which with experimental seal doth warrant the tenure of my book trust not my age my reverence calling nor divinity if this sweet lady lie not guiltless here under some biting error leon friar it cannot be thou seest that all the grace that she hath left is that she will not add to her damnation a sin of perjury she not denies it why seekst thou then to cover with excuse that which appears in proper nakedness friar lady what man is he you are accusd of hero they know that do accuse me i know none if i know more of any man alive than that which maiden modesty doth warrant let all my sins lack mercy o my father prove you that any man with me conversd at hours unmeet or that i yesternight maintaind the change of words with any creature refuse me hate me torture me to death friar there is some strange misprision in the princes bene two of them have the very bent of honour and if their wisdoms be misled in this the practice of it lives in john the bastard whose spirits toil in frame of villanies leon i know not if they speak but truth of her these hands shall tear her if they wrong her honour the proudest of them shall well hear of it time hath not yet so dried this blood of mine nor age so eat up my invention nor fortune made such havoc of my means nor my bad life reft me so much of friends but they shall find awakd in such a kind both strength of limb and policy of mind ability in means and choice of friends to quit me of them throughly friar pause awhile and let my counsel sway you in this case your daughter here the princes left for dead let her awhile be secretly kept in and publish it that she is dead indeed maintain a mourning ostentation and on your familys old monument hang mournful epitaphs and do all rites that appertain unto a burial leon what shall become of this what will this do friar marry this well carried shall on her behalf change slander to remorse that is some good but not for that dream i on this strange course but on this travail look for greater birth she dying as it must be so maintaind upon the instant that she was accusd shall be lamented pitied and excusd of every hearer for it so falls out that what we have we prize not to the worth whiles we enjoy it but being lackd and lost why then we rack the value then we find the virtue that possession would not show us whiles it was ours so will it fare with claudio when he shall hear she died upon his words th idea of her life shall sweetly creep into his study of imagination and every lovely organ of her life shall come apparelld in more precious habit more moving delicate and full of life into the eye and prospect of his soul than when she livd indeed then shall he mourn if ever love had interest in his liver and wish he had not so accused her no though be thought his accusation true let this be so and doubt not but success will fashion the event in better shape than i can lay it down in likelihood but if all aim but this be levelld false the supposition of the ladys death will quench the wonder of her infamy and if it sort not well you may conceal her as best befits her wounded reputation in some reclusive and religious life out of all eyes tongues minds and injuries bene signior leonato let the friar advise you and though you know my inwardness and love is very much unto the prince and claudio yet by mine honour i will deal in this as secretly and justly as your soul should with your body leon being that i flow in grief the smallest twine may lead me friar tis well consented presently away for to strange sores strangely they strain the cure come lady die to live this wedding day perhaps is

bene tarry sweet beatrice beat i am gone though i am here there is no love in you nay i pray you let me go bene beatrice beat in faith i will go bene well be friends first beat you dare easier be friends with me than fight with mine enemy bene is claudio thine enemy beat is a not approved in the height a villain that hath slandered scorned dishonoured my kinswoman o that i were a man what bear her in hand until they come to take hands and then with public accusation uncoverd slander unmitigated rancouro god that i were a man i would eat his heart in the market place bene hear me beatrice beat talk with a man out at a windowa proper saying bene nay but beatrice beat sweet hero she is wrongd she is slandred she is undone bene beat beat princes and counties surely a princely testimony a goodly count count comfect a sweet gallant surely o that i were a man for his sake or that i had any friend would be a man for my sake but manhood is melted into cursies valour into compliment and men are only turnd into tongue and trim ones too he is now as valiant as hercules that only tells a lieand swears it i cannot be a man with wishing therefore i will die a woman with grieving bene tarry good beatrice by this hand i love thee beat use it for my love some other way than swearing by it bene think you in your soul the count claudio hath wrongd hero beat yea as sure is i have a thought or

not the penalty of adam the seasons difference as the icy fang and churlish chiding of the winters wind which when it bites and blows upon my body even till i shrink with cold i smile and say this is no flattery these are counsellors that feelingly persuade me what i am sweet are the uses of adversity which like the toad ugly and venomous wears yet a precious jewel in his head and this our life exempt from public haunt finds tongues in trees books in the running brooks sermons in stones and good in everything i would not change it amiens happy is your grace that can translate the stubbornness of fortune into so quiet and so sweet a style duke senior come shall we go and kill us venison and yet it irks me the poor dappled fools being native burghers of this desert city should

poor sequestred stag that from the hunters aim had taen a hurt did come to languish and indeed my lord the wretched animal heavd forth such groans that their discharge did stretch his leathern coat almost to bursting and the big round tears coursd one another down his innocent nose in piteous chase and thus the hairy fool much marked of the melancholy jaques stood on th extremest verge of the swift brook augmenting it with tears duke senior but what said jaques did he not moralize this spectacle first lord o yes into a thousand similes first for his weeping into the needless stream poor deer quoth he thou makst a testament as worldlings do giving thy sum of more to that which had too much then being there alone left and abandoned of his velvet friends tis right quoth he thus misery doth part the flux of company anon a careless herd full of the pasture jumps along by him and never stays to greet him ay quoth jaques sweep on you fat and greasy citizens tis just the fashion wherefore do you look upon that poor and broken bankrupt there thus most invectively he pierceth through the body of the country city court yea and of this our life swearing that we are mere usurpers tyrants and whats worse to fright the animals and to kill them up in their assignd and native dwellingplace duke senior and did you leave him in this contemplation second lord we did my lord weeping

this desert cheerly good adam exeunt scene vii the forest a table set out enter duke senior amiens and lords like outlaws duke senior i think he be transformd into a beast for i can nowhere find him like a man first lord my lord he is but even now gone hence here was he merry hearing of a song duke senior if he compact of jars grow musical we shall have shortly discord in the spheres go seek him tell him i would speak with him enter jaques first lord he saves my labour by his own approach duke senior why how now monsieur what a life is this that your poor friends must woo your company what you look merrily jaques a fool a fool i met a fool i th forest a motley fool a miserable world as i do live by food i met a fool who laid him down and baskd him in the sun and raild on lady fortune in good terms in good set terms and yet a motley fool good morrow fool quoth i no sir quoth he call me not fool till heaven hath sent me fortune and then he drew a dial from his poke and looking on it with lacklustre eye says very wisely it is ten oclock thus we may see quoth he how the world wags tis but an hour ago since it was nine and after one hour more twill be eleven and so from hour to hour we ripe and ripe and then from hour to hour we rot and rot and thereby hangs a tale when i did hear the motley fool thus moral on the time my lungs began to crow like chanticleer that fools should be so deep contemplative and i did laugh sans intermission an hour by his dial o noble fool a worthy fool motleys the only wear duke senior what fool is this jaques o worthy fool one that hath been a courtier and says if ladies be but young and fair they have the gift to know it and in his brain which is as dry as the remainder biscuit after a voyage he hath strange places crammd with observation the which he vents in mangled forms o that i were a fool i am ambitious for a motley coat duke senior thou shalt have one jaques it is my only suit provided that you weed your better judgments of all opinion that grows rank in them that i am wise i must have liberty withal as large a charter as the wind to blow on whom i please for so fools have and they that are most galled with my folly they most must laugh and why sir must they so the why is plain as way to parish church he that a fool doth very wisely hit doth very foolishly although he smart not to seem senseless of the bob if not the wise mans folly is anatomizd even by the squandring glances of the fool invest me in my motley give me leave to speak my mind and i will through and through cleanse the foul body of th infected world if they will patiently receive my medicine duke senior fie on thee i can tell what thou wouldst do jaques what for a counter would i do but good duke senior most mischievous foul sin in chiding sin for thou thyself hast been a libertine as sensual as the brutish sting itself and all th embossed sores and headed evils that thou with license of free foot hast caught wouldst thou disgorge into the general world jaques why who cries out on pride that can therein tax any private party doth it not flow as hugely as the sea till that the wearers very means do ebb what woman in the city do i name when that i say the citywoman bears the cost of princes on unworthy shoulders who can come in and say that i mean her when such a one as she such is her neighbour or what is he of basest function that says his bravery is not on my cost thinking that i mean him but therein suits his folly to the mettle of my speech there then how then what then let me see wherein my tongue hath wrongd him if it do him right then he hath wrongd himself if he be free why then my taxing like a wildgoose flies unclaimd of any man but who comes here enter orlando with his sword drawn orlando forbear and eat no more jaques why i have eat none yet orlando nor shalt not till necessity be servd jaques of what kind should this cock come of duke senior art thou thus boldend man by thy distress or else a rude despiser

gentleness shall force more than your force move us to gentleness orlando i almost die for food and let me have it duke senior sit down and feed and welcome to our table orlando speak you so gently pardon me i pray you i thought that all things had been savage here and therefore put i on the countenance of stern commandment but whateer you are that in this desert inaccessible under the shade of melancholy boughs lose and neglect the creeping hours of time if ever you have lookd on better days if ever been where bells have knolld to church if ever sat at any good mans feast if ever from your eyelids wipd a tear and know what tis to pity and be pitied let gentleness my strong enforcement be in the which hope i blush and hide my sword duke senior true is it that we have seen better days and have with holy bell been knolld to church and sat at good mens feasts and wipd our eyes of drops that sacred pity hath engendred and therefore sit you down in gentleness and take upon command what help we have that to your wanting may be ministred orlando then but forbear your food a little while whiles like a doe i go to find my fawn and give it food there is an old poor man who after me hath many a weary step limpd in pure love till he be first sufficd oppressd with two weak evils age and hunger i will not touch a bit duke senior go find him out and we will nothing waste till you return orlando i thank ye and be blest for your good comfort exit duke senior thou seest we are not all alone unhappy this wide and universal theatre presents more woeful pageants than the scene wherein we play in jaques all the worlds a stage and all the men and women merely players they have their exits and their entrances and one man in his time plays many parts his acts being seven ages at first the infant mewling and puking in the nurses arms then the whining schoolboy with his satchel and shining morning face creeping like snail unwillingly to school and then the lover sighing like furnace with a woeful ballad made to his mistress eyebrow then a soldier full of strange oaths and bearded like the pard jealous in honour sudden and quick in quarrel seeking the bubble reputation even in the cannons mouth and then the justice in fair round belly with good capon lind with eyes severe and beard of formal cut full of wise saws and modern instances and so he plays his part the sixth age shifts into the lean and slipperd pantaloon with spectacles on nose and pouch on side his youthful hose well savd a world too wide for his shrunk shank and his big manly voice turning again toward childish treble pipes and whistles in his sound last scene of all that ends this strange eventful history is second childishness and mere oblivion sans teeth sans eyes sans taste sans every thing

writing love songs in their barks orlando i pray you mar no more of my verses with reading them illfavouredly jaques rosalind is your loves name orlando yes just jaques i do not like her name orlando there was no thought of pleasing you when she was christend jaques what stature is she of orlando just as high as my heart jaques you are full of pretty answers have you not been acquainted with goldsmiths wives and connd them out of rings orlando not so but i answer you right painted cloth from whence you have studied your questions jaques you have a nimble wit i think twas made of atalantas heels will you sit down with me and we two will rail against our mistress the world and all our misery orlando i will chide no breather in the world but myself against whom i know most faults jaques the worst fault you have is to be in love orlando tis a fault i will not change for your best virtue i am weary of you jaques by my troth i was seeking for a fool when i found you orlando he is drownd in the brook look but in and you shall see him jaques there i shall see mine own figure orlando which i take to be either a fool or a cipher jaques ill tarry no longer with you farewell good signior

hear forester orlando very well what would you rosalind i pray you what ist oclock orlando you should ask me what time o day theres no clock in the forest rosalind then there is no true lover in the forest else sighing every minute and groaning every hour would detect the lazy foot of time as well as a clock orlando and why not the swift foot of time had not that been as proper rosalind by no means sir time travels in divers paces with divers persons ill tell you who time ambles withal who time trots withal who time gallops withal and who he stands still withal orlando i prithee who doth he trot withal rosalind marry he trots hard with a young maid between the contract of her marriage and the day it is solemnizd if the interim be but a sennight times pace is so hard that it seems the length of seven year orlando who ambles time withal rosalind with a priest that lacks latin and a rich man that hath not the gout for the one sleeps easily because he cannot study and the other lives merrily because he feels no pain the one lacking the burden of lean and wasteful learning the other knowing no burden of heavy tedious penury these time ambles withal orlando who doth he gallop withal rosalind with a thief to the gallows for though he go as softly as foot can fall he thinks himself too soon there orlando who stays it still withal rosalind with lawyers in the vacation for they sleep between term and term and then they perceive not how time moves orlando where dwell you pretty youth rosalind with this shepherdess my sister here in the skirts of the forest like fringe upon a petticoat orlando are you native of this place rosalind as the coney that you see dwell where she is kindled orlando your accent is something finer than you could purchase in so removed a dwelling rosalind i have been told so of many but indeed an old religious uncle of mine taught me to speak who was in his youth an inland man one that knew courtship too well for there he fell in love i have heard him read many lectures against it and i thank god i am not a woman to be touchd with so many giddy offences as he hath generally taxd their whole sex withal orlando can you remember any of the principal evils that he laid to the charge of women rosalind there were none principal they were all like one another as halfpence are every one fault seeming monstrous till his fellowfault came to match it orlando i prithee recount some of them rosalind no i will not cast away my physic but on those that are sick there is a man haunts the forest that abuses our young plants with carving rosalind on their barks hangs odes upon hawthorns and elegies on brambles all forsooth deifying the name of rosalind if i could meet that fancymonger i would give him some good counsel for he seems to have the quotidian of love upon him orlando i am he that is so loveshakd i pray you tell me your remedy rosalind there is none of my uncles marks upon you he taught me how to know a man in love in which cage of rushes i am sure you are not prisoner orlando what were his marks rosalind a lean cheek which you have not a blue eye and sunken which you have not an unquestionable spirit which you have not a beard neglected which you have not but i pardon you for that for simply your having in beard is a younger brothers revenue then your hose should be ungarterd your bonnet unbanded your sleeve unbuttond your shoe untied and every thing about you demonstrating a careless desolation but you are no such man you are rather pointdevice in your accoutrements as loving yourself than seeming the lover of any other orlando fair youth i would i could make thee believe i love rosalind me believe it you may as soon make her that you love believe it which i warrant she is apter to do than to confess she does that is one of the points in the which women still give the lie to their consciences but in good sooth are you he that hangs the verses on the trees wherein rosalind is so admired orlando i swear to thee youth by the white hand of rosalind i am that he that unfortunate he rosalind but are you so much in love as your rhymes speak orlando neither rhyme nor reason can express how much rosalind love is merely a madness and i tell you deserves as well a dark house and a whip as madmen do and the reason why they are not so punishd and cured is that the lunacy is so ordinary that the whippers are in love too yet i profess curing it by counsel orlando did you ever cure any so rosalind yes one and in this manner he was to imagine me his love his mistress and i set him every day to woo me at which time would i being but a moonish youth grieve be effeminate changeable longing and liking proud fantastical apish shallow inconstant full of tears full of smiles for every passion something and for no passion truly anything as boys and women are for the most part cattle of this colour would now like him now loathe him then entertain him then forswear him now weep for him then spit at him that i drave my suitor from his mad humour of love to a living humour of madness which was to forswear the full stream of the world and to live in a nook merely monastic and thus i curd him and this way will i take upon me to wash your liver as clean as a sound sheeps heart that there shall not be one spot of love in t orlando i would not be cured youth rosalind i would cure you if you would but call me rosalind and come every day to my cote and woo me orlando now by the faith of my love i will tell me where it is rosalind go with me to it and ill show it you and by the way you

the gods had made thee poetical audrey i do not know what poetical is is it honest in deed and word is it a true thing touchstone no truly for the truest poetry is the most feigning and lovers are given to poetry and what they swear in poetry may be said as lovers they do feign audrey do you wish then that the gods had made me poetical touchstone i do truly for thou swearst to me thou art honest now if thou wert a poet i might have some hope thou didst feign audrey would you not have me honest touchstone no truly unless thou wert hardfavourd for honesty coupled to beauty is to have honey a sauce to sugar jaques aside a material fool audrey well i am not fair and therefore i pray the gods make me honest touchstone truly and to cast away honesty upon a foul slut were to put good

though courage as horns are odious they are necessary it is said many a man knows no end of his goods right many a man has good horns and knows no end of them well that is the dowry of his wife tis none of his own getting horns even so poor men alone no no the noblest deer hath them as huge as the rascal is the single man therefore blessed no as a walld town is more worthier than a village so is the forehead of a married man more honourable than the bare brow of a bachelor and by how much defence is better than no skill by so much is horn more precious than to want here comes sir oliver enter

marry his kisses are judass own children rosalind i faith his hair is of a good colour celia an excellent colour your chestnut was ever the only colour rosalind and his kissing is as full of sanctity as the touch of holy bread celia he hath bought a pair of cast lips of diana a nun of winters sisterhood kisses not more religiously the very ice of chastity is in them rosalind but why did he swear he would come this morning and comes not celia nay certainly there is no truth in him rosalind do you think so celia yes i think he is not a pickpurse nor a horsestealer but for his verity in love i do think him as concave as covered goblet or a wormeaten nut rosalind not true in love celia yes when he is in but i think he is not in rosalind you have heard him swear downright he was celia was is not is besides the oath of a lover is no stronger than the word of a tapster they are both the confirmer of false reckonings he attends here in the forest on the duke your father rosalind i met the duke yesterday and had much question with him he asked me of what parentage i was i told him of as good as he so he laughd and let me go but what talk we of fathers when there is such a man as orlando celia o thats a brave man he writes brave verses speaks brave words swears brave oaths and breaks them bravely quite traverse athwart the heart of his lover as a puny tilter that spurs his horse but on one side breaks his staff like a noble goose but alls brave that youth mounts and folly guides who comes here enter corin corin mistress and master you have oft enquired after the shepherd that

frown on thee with all my heart and if mine eyes can wound now let them kill thee now counterfeit to swoon why now fall down or if thou canst not o for shame for shame lie not to say mine eyes are murderers now show the wound mine eye hath made in thee scratch thee but with a pin and there remains some scar of it lean upon a rush the cicatrice and capable impressure thy palm some moment keeps

jaques i have neither the scholars melancholy which is emulation nor the musicians which is fantastical nor the courtiers which is proud nor the soldiers which is ambitious nor the lawyers which is politic nor the ladys which is nice nor the lovers which is all these but it is a melancholy of mine own compounded of many simples extracted from many objects and indeed the sundry contemplation of my travels in which my often rumination wraps me in a most humorous sadness rosalind a traveller by my faith you have great reason to be sad i fear you have sold your own lands to see other mens then to have seen much and to have nothing is to have rich eyes and poor hands jaques yes i have gaind my experience enter orlando rosalind and your experience makes you sad i had rather have a fool to

wiser the waywarder make the doors upon a womans wit and it will out at the casement shut that and twill out at the keyhole stop that twill fly with the smoke out at the chimney orlando a man that had a wife with such a wit he might say wit whither wilt rosalind nay you might keep that check for it till you met your wifes wit going to your neighbours bed orlando and what wit could wit have to excuse that rosalind marry to say she came to seek you there you shall never take her without her answer unless you take her without her tongue o that woman that cannot make her fault her husbands

he threw his eye aside and mark what object did present itself under an oak whose boughs were mossd with age and high top bald with dry antiquity a wretched ragged man oergrown with hair lay sleeping on his back about his neck a green and gilded snake had wreathd itself who with her head nimble in threats approachd the opening of his mouth but suddenly seeing orlando it unlinkd itself and with indented glides did slip away into a bush under which bushs shade a lioness with udders all drawn dry lay couching head on ground with catlike watch when that the sleeping man should stir for tis the royal disposition of that beast to prey on nothing that doth seem as dead this seen orlando did approach the man and found it was his brother his elder brother celia o i have heard him speak of that same brother and he did render him the most unnatural that livd amongst men oliver and well he might so do for well i know he was unnatural rosalind but to orlando did he leave him there food to the suckd and hungry lioness oliver twice did he turn his back and purposd so but kindness nobler ever than revenge and nature stronger than his just occasion made him give battle to the lioness who quickly fell before him in which hurtling from miserable slumber i awakd celia are you his brother rosalind wast you he rescud celia wast you that did so oft contrive to kill him oliver twas i but tis

brief i recoverd him bound up his wound and after some small space being strong at heart he sent me hither stranger as i am to tell this story that you might excuse his broken promise and to give this napkin dyd in his blood unto the shepherd youth that he in sport doth call his rosalind rosalind swoons celia why how now ganymede sweet ganymede oliver many will swoon when they do look on blood

my spouse from whom my absence was not six months old before herself almost at fainting under the pleasing punishment that women bear had made provision for her following me and soon and safe arrived

worthily termd them merciless to us for ere the ships could meet by twice five leagues we were encountred by a mighty rock which being violently borne upon our helpful ship was splitted in the midst so that in this unjust divorce of us fortune had left to both of us alike what to delight in what to sorrow for her part poor soul seeming as burdened with lesser weight but not with lesser woe was carried with more speed before the wind and in our sight they three were taken up by fishermen of corinth as we thought at length another ship had seizd on us and knowing whom it was their hap to save gave healthful welcome to their shipwreckd guests and would have reft the fishers of their prey had not their bark been very slow of sail and therefore homeward did they bend their course thus have

for shame othello why how now ho from whence ariseth this are we turnd turks and to ourselves do that which heaven hath forbid the ottomites for christian shame put by this barbarous brawl he that stirs next to carve for his own rage holds his soul light he dies upon his motion silence that dreadful bell it frights the isle from her propriety what is the matter masters honest iago that lookst dead with grieving speak who began this on thy love i charge thee iago i do not know friends all but now even now in quarter and in terms like bride and groom devesting them for bed and then but now as if some planet had unwitted men swords out and tilting one at others breast in opposition bloody i cannot speak any beginning to this peevish odds and would in action glorious i had lost those legs that brought me to a part of it othello how comes it michael you are thus forgot cassio i pray you pardon me i cannot speak othello worthy montano you were wont be civil the gravity and stillness of your youth the world hath noted and your name is great in mouths of wisest censure whats the matter that you unlace your reputation thus and spend your rich opinion for the name of a nightbrawler give me answer to it montano worthy othello i am hurt to danger your officer iago can inform you while i spare speech which something now offends me of all that i do know nor know i aught by me thats said or done amiss this night unless selfcharity be sometimes a vice and to defend ourselves it be a sin when violence assails us othello now by heaven my blood begins my safer guides to rule and passion having my best judgement collied assays to lead the way if i once stir or do but lift this arm the best of you shall sink in my rebuke give me to know how this foul rout began who set it on and he that is approved in this offense though he had twinnd with me both at a birth shall lose me what in a town of war yet wild the peoples hearts brimful of fear to manage private and domestic quarrel in night and on the court and guard of safety tis monstrous iago who begant montano if partially affined or leagued in office thou dost deliver more or less than truth thou art no soldier iago touch me not so near i had rather have this tongue cut from my mouth than it should do offense to michael cassio yet i persuade myself to speak the truth shall nothing wrong him thus it is general montano and myself being in speech there comes a fellow crying out for help and cassio following him with determined sword to execute upon him sir this gentleman steps in to cassio and entreats his pause myself the crying fellow did pursue lest by his clamor as it so fell out the town might fall in fright he swift of foot outran my purpose and i returnd the rather for that i heard the clink and fall of swords and cassio high in oath which till tonight i neer might say before when i came back for this was brief i found them close together at blow and thrust even as again they were when you yourself did part them more of this matter cannot i report but men are men the best sometimes forget though cassio did some little wrong to him as men in rage strike those that wish them best yet surely cassio i believe received from him that fled some strange indignity which patience could not pass othello i know iago thy honesty and love doth mince this matter making it light to cassio cassio i love thee

reputation o i have lost my reputation i have lost the immortal part of myself and what remains is bestial my reputation iago my reputation iago as i am an honest man i thought you had received some bodily wound there is more sense in that than in reputation reputation is an idle and most false imposition oft got without merit and lost without deserving you have lost no reputation at all unless you repute yourself such a loser what man there are ways to recover the general again you are but now cast in his mood a punishment more in policy than in malice even so as one would beat his offenseless dog to affright an imperious lion sue to him again and hes yours cassio i will rather sue to be despised than to deceive so good a commander with so slight so drunken and so indiscreet an officer drunk and speak parrot and squabble swagger swear and discourse fustian with ones own shadow o thou invisible spirit of wine if thou hast no name to be known by let us call thee devil iago what was he that you followed with your sword what had he done to you cassio i know not iago ist possible cassio i remember a mass of things but nothing distinctly a quarrel but nothing wherefore o god that men should put an enemy in their mouths to steal away their brains that we should with joy pleasance revel and applause transform ourselves into beasts iago why but you are now well enough how came you thus recovered cassio it hath pleased the devil drunkenness to give place to the devil wrath one unperfectness shows me another to make me frankly despise myself iago come you are too severe a moraler as the time the place and the condition of this country stands i could heartily wish this had not befallen but since it is as it is mend it for your own good cassio i will ask him for my place again he shall tell me i am a drunkard had i as many mouths as hydra such an answer would stop them all to be now a sensible man by and by a fool and presently a beast o strange every inordinate cup is unblest and the ingredient is a devil iago come come good wine is a good familiar creature if it be well used exclaim no more against it and good lieutenant i think you think i love you cassio i have well approved it sir i drunk iago you or any man living may be drunk at some time man ill tell you what you shall do our generals wife is now the general i may say so in this respect for that he hath devoted and given up himself to the contemplation mark and denotement of her parts and graces confess yourself freely to her importune her help to put you in your place again she is of so free so kind so apt so blessed a disposition she holds it a vice in her goodness not to do more than she is requested this broken joint between you and her husband entreat her to splinter and my fortunes against any lay worth naming this crack of your love shall grow stronger than it was before cassio you advise me well iago i protest in the sincerity of love and honest kindness cassio i think it freely and betimes in the morning i will beseech the virtuous desdemona to undertake for me i am desperate of my fortunes if they check me here iago you are in the right good night lieutenant i must to the watch cassio good night honest iago exit iago and whats he then that says i play the villain when this advice is free i give and honest probal to thinking and indeed the course to win the moor again for tis most easy the inclining desdemona to subdue in any honest suit shes framed as fruitful as the free elements and then for her to win the moor weret to renounce his baptism all seals and symbols of redeemed sin his soul is so enfetterd to her love that she may make unmake do what she list even as her appetite shall play the god with his weak function how am i then a villain to counsel cassio to this parallel course directly to his good divinity of hell when devils will the blackest sins put on they do suggest at first with heavenly shows as i do now for whiles this honest fool plies desdemona to repair his fortune and she for him pleads strongly to the moor ill pour this pestilence into his ear that she repeals him for her bodys lust and by how much she strives to do him good she shall undo her credit with the moor so will i turn her virtue into pitch and out of her own goodness make the net that shall enmesh them all enter roderigo how now roderigo roderigo i do follow here in the chase not like a hound that hunts but one that fills up the cry my money is almost spent i have been tonight exceedingly well cudgeled and i think the issue will be i shall have so much experience for my pains and so with no money at all and a little more wit return again to venice iago how poor are they that have not patience what wound did ever heal but by degrees thou knowst we work by wit and not by witchcraft and wit depends on dilatory time doest not go well cassio hath beaten thee and thou by that small hurt hast cashierd cassio though other things grow fair against the sun yet fruits that blossom first will first be ripe content thyself awhile by the mass tis morning pleasure and action make the hours seem short retire thee go where thou art billeted away i say thou shalt know more hereafter nay get thee gone exit roderigo two things are to be done my wife must move for cassio to her mistress ill set her on myself the while to draw the moor apart and bring him jump when he may cassio find soliciting his wife ay thats the way dull not device by coldness and delay exit act iii scene i before the castle enter cassio and some musicians cassio
